    <meta name="description" content="In the 1930s, during America's worst financial crises, the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt employed photographers to document the plight of everyday folk in the Great Depression in order to push forward with their New Deal programs. Documentary photographers Dorothea Lange and Walker Evans were prolific frontrunners of these efforts and their extraordinary photographs continue to endure today. Their artistic and documentary mastery and historical importance provide key insight into a monumental turning point in American history.">

                  For James Abbott McNeill Whistler and his nineteenth-century
                  peers, the word <em>Tanagra</em> conjured the image of a small
                  terracotta figurine from Hellenistic Greece, typically
                  depicting an elegantly draped woman, naturalistically modeled
                  and enlivened with paint, perhaps veiled or wearing a
                  wide-brimmed hat, and holding a fan or a floral garland. As
                  Linda Merrill and Beth Cohen explore in their contributions to
                  this catalogue, the word, and the ancient objects it evoked,
                  not only revolutionized the nineteenth-century perception of
                  Greek art, now recast as something modern, vibrant, and
                  accessible in both demeanor and scale, in sharp contrast to
                  the monumental public marbles that defined the prevailing
                  image of classical art at the time, but it also quickly came
                  to embody a certain aesthetic mood or style that gave
                  classicizing form to the contemporary female body and to
                  contemporary notions of ideal femininity. In this sense, the
                  nineteenth-century reception of Tanagra figurines and the
                  diffuse deployment of their image in art and fashion was not
                  so far removed from their ancient function as models and
                  modelers of ideal Greek womanhood.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The figurines themselves were produced across the Hellenistic
                  world but take their modern name from the site of Tanagra in
                  Boeotia in northern Greece, a leading center of production in
                  antiquity. Significant numbers were first discovered in the
                  1870s, buried inside tombs.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  Although representations of men, children, the elderly, and
                  gods are also known (see e.g., cat. nos 6 and 10), most extant
                  Tanagras depict adult, mortal women, identifiable as such by
                  their costumes, accessories, and poses.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  Decorated with precious pigments, and in some instances also
                  with gold, they give tantalizing insight into both the
                  original appearance of large-scale painted sculpture and the
                  dressed bodies of real women in antiquity (fig. 1). Indeed, as
                  Linda Merrill demonstrates, it was the extensive survival of
                  Tanagrasâ polychrome decoration, as well as their intimate,
                  seemingly feminine character and scale, that excited
                  nineteenth-century collectors, artists, and scholars, who
                  interpreted them as bourgeois ornaments for the home and the
                  tomb, the ancient precursors of so many Victorian gewgaws.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Yet, the archaeological evidence suggests that Tanagra
                  figurines in fact most likely served as votives in both
                  funerary and sanctuary contexts,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  implying significance beyond passive decoration or fashion
                  archive. Hollow cast using two-piece molds (cat. no. 2), they
                  were infinitely replicable, easily mass-produced, and more
                  affordable than figurines made from metals or stone,
                  facilitating widespread distribution across potentially broad
                  social strata. Examples have been excavated in tombs alongside
                  jewelry, mirrors, and perfume vessels, indicating a feminine
                  context, and they seem to have been especially popular grave
                  gifts for children, where they perhaps embodied the adult
                  roles of wife and mother that the deceased child would now no
                  longer achieve.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Others have been found in sanctuaries dedicated to deities
                  connected with marriage, sex, and fertility, or else with the
                  passage from childhood to adulthood, including Aphrodite,
                  Artemis, Demeter, and Kore.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  At the town of Priene, Tanagras have been documented in
                  domestic contexts again alongside objects like loom weights
                  and cooking utensils that are conventionally associated with
                  women, thus prompting scholars to question whether they were
                  made and purchased first as votives or were personal
                  possessions later repurposed.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sheila Dillon has argued that the ways in which many of the
                  female Tanagras are depictedâlavishly draped, veiled, and
                  accessorizedâdefines them as both elite and ideally beautiful,
                  and places them explicitly within the world of religious
                  rituals and public festivals, that is, âthe world of women on
                  the public stage.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  Indeed, as Dillon observes, it can be no coincidence that
                  Tanagra figurines first emerged as a class of objects in
                  Athens at the same time as marble portrait statues of women,
                  which often share the same poses and costumes, begin to be
                  dedicated in the city as votives to celebrate womenâs public
                  and religious roles as priestesses [(fig. 2).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  This suggests a functional as well as formal relationship
                  between the two types of sculpture, positioning female
                  Tanagras as miniature monuments to Hellenistic womenâs
                  participation in, and contribution to, the ritual life of the
                  city, the family, and the home.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  This in turn opens the way for the Tanagra figurine to
                  function as the epitome of femininity, defining womenâs ideal
                  public roles and social identities by offering a model of
                  appearance and behavior. Certainly, if we consider girls to be
                  one primary audience, as the funerary evidence would suggest,
                  then these Tanagras become terracotta Barbies, presenting an
                  aspirational female physique, costume, demeanor, and role for
                  their young viewers to grow into.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                  But our understanding of how Tanagra figurines defined and
                  diffused an image and idea of Greek womanhood is nuanced and
                  reoriented by drawing attention to the materiality of the
                  statuettes alongside their iconography.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                  Considering the significance of pigment and clay, and that of
                  the processes of molding, casting, and painting, provides
                  metaphors for the construction and conceptualization of the
                  female body and of female identity in the Greek world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This returns agency to terracotta as a medium and to molding
                  as a technique, both easily dismissed as nothing more than
                  cheap alternatives to other materials and processes.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                  But by placing the Tanagras in conversation with an ancient
                  literary discourse that defined women as manufactured objects,
                  a hollow container and painted surface, a materialist approach
                  such as this creates space for the exploration of female
                  subjectivity and the potential for self-fashioning through the
                  same processes of adornment, draping, shaping and molding that
                  characterized both Tanagra production and dominant patriarchal
                  views of female identity in the Greek world.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                </p>
                <h2>Shaping the body</h2>
                <p>
                  As has been widely discussed by Dillon and others, in terms of
                  their costume, pose, and activities, the female Tanagras
                  embody a socially determined ideal of mortal femininity, in
                  contrast to divine, that is defined by the competing
                  expectations of modesty, beauty, restraint, and sexual
                  allure.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                  In the Greek world, it was considered a womanâs duty to be
                  desirable to attract a husband and bear children. A wife was
                  consequently required to maintain standards of beauty,
                  cultivation, and refinement.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                  Sartorial elegance was also a marker of privileged status.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  Yet, male anxiety around womenâs unchecked sexuality as a
                  threat to male honor meant that modesty in dress and behavior
                  was simultaneously promoted as a virtue; womenâs adornment was
                  always viewed as potentially treacherous. For this reason,
                  laws restricted the color, transparency, and cost of garments
                  that women could wear during religious rituals, while
                  treatises warned women against wearing gold, jewels, and
                  imported silk to protect their reputations.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  It should not surprise us, therefore, that in modeling an
                  image of the ideal Greek woman, Tanagra figurines play with
                  contrasting ideas of visibility and invisibility, and of
                  propriety and ostentation, making the contradictory demands
                  that society placed on women integral to the form and fabric
                  of her body. This is most apparent in terms of costume and
                  pose. Most female Tanagras are conventionally dressed
                  according to contemporary fashion. A long, belted tunic
                  (<em>chiton</em>) covers most of the feet beneath a
                  lightweight mantle (<em>himation</em>) that is wrapped around
                  the body and held in place with the arms, often covering the
                  hands (cat. no. 4 is representative).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>
                  Many pull their mantle over their hair (e.g., [cat. no. 3),
                  and some wear a face veil (<em>tegidion</em>) (e[.g., cat. no.
                  8, here folded over the crown of the head like a
                  kerchief);<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                  if heads appear uncovered, hair is always carefully coiffed
                  and controlled.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                  Arms are often crossed over the torso or raised to the chin in
                  a conventional gesture that signals modest restraint.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a result, these women appear swaddled beneath their
                  voluminous drapery, their bodies concealed and constricted in
                  a way that was deemed appropriate for public appearances,
                  especially at religious festivals,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  but that simultaneously embodied the desired feminine ideals
                  of modesty, propriety, and submissiveness that endowed the
                  respectable wife with ideal beauty.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                  And yet, at the same time as it obscured the body, the volume
                  of fabric worn by Hellenistic women was finely pleated,
                  meticulously layered and draped, and brightly colored with
                  expensive dyes to attract the eye, distinguish the wearer from
                  others, and signal her wealth and prestige. So, too, did the
                  sophistication required to control and move elegantly within
                  it.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  The care with which the makers of these figurines delineated
                  the textures of different textiles, evoking the transparency
                  of fine Coan silk or Egyptian linen, colored with paint made
                  from the same costly pigments that dyed the fabrics themselves
                  (cat. no. 6), suggests that the ways in which dress made the
                  wearer visible and desirable was of equal importance to the
                  expression of elite female identity, as was the performance of
                  modesty.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even the poses work to bring the body beneath the fabric to
                  the fore. One representative terracotta found at Tanagra
                  itself, now in the Louvre (cat. no. 3), is shown with lowered
                  gaze, clutching her mantle tightly over her head and across
                  her torso with her right arm, which is raised beneath the
                  cloak to her chest. She grips her skirt and the loose folds of
                  the mantle with her left hand, held at her waist in a way that
                  nevertheless accentuates the tilt of her hips and the curve of
                  her right thigh. Another terracotta from ancient Myrina in
                  Asia Minor, now also in the Louvre, even lifts her skirts and
                  extends her body into a sensuous contrapposto curve, with one
                  hip thrust languorously to the side (cat. no. 9). As Sarah
                  Blundell notes, in almost every instance in which a woman is
                  shown clutching at her clothes on Athenian vases, the gesture
                  âcarried intimations of eroticism.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                  The same is true here: even as they seemingly attempt to
                  shield themselves from the gaze of onlookers, these figurines
                  pull their drapery tight across hips, breasts, bellies and
                  thighs, effectively sculpting the body in a way that
                  emphasizes its physical desirability. Indeed, their poses
                  mimic the hipshot coquetry of the Aphrodite of Knidos, the
                  famous cult statue of the goddess created by the Greek
                  sculptor Praxiteles in the fourth century BCE, whose
                  disingenuous attempts to shield her nudity with her arms
                  instead directed her viewerâs desirous gaze precisely towards
                  what was not meant to be seen (fig. 3; also cat. 10).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  By evoking the Knidia, the Tanagrasâ body language hints at
                  the fertility and sexual allure of the respectable wife, and
                  of the pleasures of removing the drapery that signified her
                  virtuous reserve.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                  At the same time, they remind their female viewer that only
                  adornment offers mortal women Aphroditeâs charm.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>
                  But in the case of the Tanagras, of course, there is no body
                  beneath the cloth; they are completely hollow thanks to the
                  process by which they were made.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>
                  These figures are their drapery, making tangible the
                  prevailing Greek notion that the mortal female body was a
                  clothed body, or rather, that the dressed and adorned body was
                  womanâs natural state.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>
                  Pandora, the first woman of Greek myth, provides the paradigm.

                    Forthwith [Hephaistos] the famous Lame God molded clay in

                    purposed. And the goddess bright-eyed Athene girded and

                <p>
                  In the version told by the Greek poet Hesiod (thought to be
                  active around 700 BCE), Pandora comes into being through the
                  act of dressing, so that she is one and the same with the
                  finely worked garments and jewelry with which she is adorned
                  (fig. 4).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup>
                  This is, in effect, to reduce Pandora and all women that come
                  after her to decorated surfaces,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup>
                  which for Hesiod and so many other Greek writers was to define
                  woman as both highly crafted and deeply deceptive.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>
                  Pandoraâs beautifully wrought drapery and ornaments are as
                  much a marker of her inherent craftiness as are her cunning
                  words. Indeed, Greek and later Roman anti-cosmetic rhetoric
                  consistently presented womenâs adornment as a deceptive art,
                  closely and negatively associated with artificiality, to the
                  extent that authors frequently likened womenâs bodies to
                  luxury goods and manufactured objects, including vessels and
                  woven textiles, objectifying the female by highlighting the
                  constructedness and superficiality of her image.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Such analogies point to the potential gap between surface and
                  substance that adornment might open, at the same time as
                  suggesting womanâs interior emptiness, which, to the Greek
                  mind, made her both a vehicle for reproduction and an
                  insatiable glutton for luxury and sex.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>
                  Tanagras, of course, make this metaphorical hollowness literal
                  by virtue of their being cast from two-piece molds. But they
                  also make it visible: almost all figurines have a square or
                  circular opening in the back, which was ostensibly to prevent
                  the terracotta from exploding by releasing moisture and hot
                  air during the firing process (fig. 5). Yet, the typical size
                  of these openings is approximately one inch in height, which
                  is much larger than is needed to vent air from inside a
                  terracotta sculpture. It has been suggested that the holes may
                  also have provided access to the interior of the figurines to
                  facilitate the process of connecting the separately cast parts
                  from the inside. In any case, one consequence of the enlarged
                  size of the openings is that they draw attention to the
                  figurineâs emptiness as well as to its facture, making both
                  intrinsic features of the idealized female body.

                  That Pandora should, like the Tanagras, also be molded from
                  clay only reinforces her status as an artwork. Clay is the
                  original stuff of creation used to make mankind in Sumerian,
                  Egyptian, and Greek mythological traditions,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37" class="footnote-ref-anchor">37</a></sup>
                  and retains its status as the archetypal artistâs medium
                  throughout Roman histories of artistic production. Indeed, for
                  the Roman historian Gaius Plinius Secundus (Pliny the Elder,
                  ca. 23/24â79 CE), the origins of all art are dependent on it.
                  We are told that the first portrait modeled in clay was made
                  by a Greek tile-maker, Butades of Sikyon (thought to be active
                  ca. 600 BCE), who created a likeness of the young man with
                  whom his daughter was in love by pressing clay onto the
                  surface of a wall on which she had traced his silhouetted
                  profile.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38" class="footnote-ref-anchor">38</a></sup>
                  This model was reportedly preserved in the Nymphaeum in
                  Corinth until the Roman general Lucius Mummius sacked the city
                  in 146 BCE, which was itself a critical moment in Romeâs own
                  telling of its history of encounter with Greek art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39" class="footnote-ref-anchor">39</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Pliny goes on to relate how Butades used this new technique to
                  make terracotta antefixes in the shape of faces to adorn the
                  pediments of temples, a tradition supposedly exported to Italy
                  in the seventh century BCE by Demaratos of Corinth, father of
                  Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, the first king of Rome.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40" class="footnote-ref-anchor">40</a></sup>
                  In Italy at this time, clay was also used to create cult
                  statues of gods, confirming its historical significance as a
                  key medium in the development of three-dimensional figurative
                  art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41" class="footnote-ref-anchor">41</a></sup>
                  Indeed, Pliny is careful to stress how clay also undergirds
                  the work of major Greek artists such as Lysistratos, brother
                  of the celebrated sculptor Lysippos, who was the first to
                  model sculptures in clay before casting them in bronze to
                  better capture a faithful likeness.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn42" id="fnref42" class="footnote-ref-anchor">42</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Plinyâs discussion of clay as an artistâs medium is ultimately
                  concerned with establishing the boundaries of morally viable
                  cultural production in the new Roman world of empire, which
                  threatened, with its expanded boundaries, infinite resources,
                  and ever-more capacious categories for wealth, to push
                  everything into luxuriousness.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn43" id="fnref43" class="footnote-ref-anchor">43</a></sup>
                  Where luxury represented an abuse of nature and a profligate
                  waste of resources,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn44" id="fnref44" class="footnote-ref-anchor">44</a></sup>
                  clay, by contrast, was a material that could be extracted from
                  the earth without endangering it, unlike quarrying for marbles
                  or precious metals, and that did not increase the value of the
                  objects it was used to create; likewise, its original
                  association with temple decoration and the depiction of cult
                  images ensured its moral value.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn45" id="fnref45" class="footnote-ref-anchor">45</a></sup>
                  For our purposes, though, Plinyâs discussion also helps us to
                  understand how clay as a material was inextricably bound in
                  the ancient mind to the idea of original composition, lifelike
                  representation, and the touch of the artistâs hand, and was
                  also synonymous with the development of three-dimensional
                  figurative art in history as well as in myth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To make a body from clay, then, was in many ways to promote
                  its status as handmade artworkâsomething rendered tangible in
                  the many terracottas that preserve the fingerprints of their
                  maker (fig. 6).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn46" id="fnref46" class="footnote-ref-anchor">46</a></sup>
                  But it was also to engage with a literary discourse that
                  frequently ascribed the same physical properties of clay,
                  namely its malleability and the ease with which it receives
                  impressions, to the female body. According to the philosopher
                  Aristotle (384â322 BCE), the female of any species is âsofter,
                  quicker to be tamed, more receptive to handling, and readier
                  to learnâ than the male,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn47" id="fnref47" class="footnote-ref-anchor">47</a></sup>
                  characteristics we might collectively categorize as being more
                  easily susceptible to outside forces, both physical and
                  mental.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn48" id="fnref48" class="footnote-ref-anchor">48</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In texts by other male writers, womenâs flesh is considered
                  spongier, more fluid and more permeable than menâs,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn49" id="fnref49" class="footnote-ref-anchor">49</a></sup>
                  and more in need of binding and shaping. So, the Greek
                  physician Soranos of Ephesos (b. 98 CE), writing under the
                  Roman Empire, states that all newborns need careful swaddling
                  in order to âmold every part according to its natural shape,â
                  but that girls should be bound tighter across the chest and
                  more loosely around the loins to achieve the ideal female
                  form.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn50" id="fnref50" class="footnote-ref-anchor">50</a></sup>
                  As adults, Roman women might further manipulate the shape of
                  their bodies by bolstering hips, corseting stomachs, and even
                  stitching cork into the soles of their shoes,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn51" id="fnref51" class="footnote-ref-anchor">51</a></sup>
                  suggesting how the female body remained malleable and open to
                  change, even if onlyâor especiallyâin appearance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That molding itself should be considered a female act is
                  reinforced by the language of pregnancy and reproduction found
                  in the same medical and philosophical texts. The Greek word
                  <em>matrix</em> can mean both âuterusâ and âmold,â a synonymy
                  exploited in the <em>Timaeus</em> by the philosopher Plato,
                  who imagines the womb molding the fetus into shape as it
                  develops.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn52" id="fnref52" class="footnote-ref-anchor">52</a></sup>
                  Platoâs theorization of how phenomenal objects come into being
                  and change state likewise imagines a maternal spaceâthe
                  so-called Receptacleâin which phenomena appear, disappear, and
                  receive new form.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn53" id="fnref53" class="footnote-ref-anchor">53</a></sup>
                  Verbs of molding, impressing, and modeling define Platoâs
                  concept of the Receptacle, as do gendered notions of
                  pregnancy.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn54" id="fnref54" class="footnote-ref-anchor">54</a></sup>
                  In this way, human reproduction becomes analogous to processes
                  of mechanical mark-making and serial production. But we might
                  imagine a viewer of a Tanagra figurine understanding the
                  reverse to be true, too: cast from a mold that was itself cast
                  from a hand-modeled prototype, then shaped and incised with
                  tools, these terracottas make reproduction through replication
                  and craft integral to the fabrication and function of the
                  female body,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn55" id="fnref55" class="footnote-ref-anchor">55</a></sup>
                  while at the same time, embodying the common literary trope
                  that likened women to vessels and reduced them to their
                  wombs.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn56" id="fnref56" class="footnote-ref-anchor">56</a></sup>
                  Those figurines that show draped women holding swaddled
                  infants make even more explicit the conceptual link, that is
                  so deeply rooted in the Greek imagination, between womenâs
                  hollow clay bodies and their capacity for reproduction (cat.
                  no. 7).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Indeed, a parallel metaphor common in Greek literature equated
                  womenâs bodies to earth, which was considered the
                  quintessential womb,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn57" id="fnref57" class="footnote-ref-anchor">57</a></sup>
                  ready to be plowed and sown. So, we are told in the
                  <em>Timaeus</em> that the male seed is sown upon the womb âas
                  upon plowed soil,â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn58" id="fnref58" class="footnote-ref-anchor">58</a></sup>
                  while the Athenian marriage agreement, made between the
                  brideâs father and her new husband, was probably sealed with
                  the formula, âI hand over this woman to you for the plowing of
                  legitimate children.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn59" id="fnref59" class="footnote-ref-anchor">59</a></sup>
                  Not only does this reduce woman to a clay womb, a container

                  at the same time as reiterating the clay-like softness and
                  permeability of her flesh, but such metaphors of husbandry
                  once again center the importance of cultivationâin the sense
                  of both taming and refiningâto the production of the female
                  body and of female identity in the Greek world.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn61" id="fnref61" class="footnote-ref-anchor">61</a></sup>

                  This helps us to think about Pandoraâs clay fabric as critical
                  to a gendered reading of her body, and hence also any female
                  body, as both artwork and womb/mold, the handmade prototype
                  from which all women are cast.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn62" id="fnref62" class="footnote-ref-anchor">62</a></sup>
                  This in turn suggests the potential for every female Tanagra
                  to be a miniature Pandora, made of earth and adorned with
                  finery. If we accept that any female viewer of a Tanagra
                  figurine saw herself reflected in its image, dressed as she
                  may have been dressed or as she aspired to be seen, then this
                  opens the way for every woman to see herself as Pandora, too.
                  Our contention in this essay is that, for a female viewer of
                  Tanagra figurines, to see herself as Pandora may in the end
                  have been empowering rather than limiting.

                  The suggestion that women required shaping and then
                  cultivating through adornment is a trope later pushed to an
                  extreme by the Roman poet Ovid (b. 43 BCE), who likens womenâs
                  adorned bodies to a series of raw materials that are crude by
                  nature but made elegant by artistry.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn63" id="fnref63" class="footnote-ref-anchor">63</a></sup>

                  Here, Ovidâs woman is not just equated to the gemstone she
                  wears but also to the sensuous depiction of Venus engraved on
                  it. The implication is that every woman needs work if she is
                  to become civilized and fulfill the role of wife and mother
                  that society demands. But by working on her appearance, she is
                  contrivedânothing more than a shimmering image carved on the
                  surface of a polished stone, concealing a dank, earthy, and
                  hollow interior.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn65" id="fnref65" class="footnote-ref-anchor">65</a></sup>

                  Ovidâs analogy also justifies the emphasis placed in this
                  essay on the potential for female viewers in antiquity to see
                  themselves reflected in the images of women that they
                  encounteredâin both material and formâand for Tanagras
                  therefore to be miniature mirrors and models for the women who
                  looked at them. Even the Tanagrasâ painted surfaces suggest a
                  material as well as visual correspondence between viewer and
                  figurine. Most Tanagras were covered with a ground layer of
                  white clay such as kaolinite, which created a smooth surface
                  that would bind well with applied paint.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn66" id="fnref66" class="footnote-ref-anchor">66</a></sup>
                  Womenâs faces were also frequently coated with a foundation
                  layer composed of different clays and chalks that aimed to
                  achieve a smooth, pale complexion, which was a much-desired
                  indicator of social status,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn67" id="fnref67" class="footnote-ref-anchor">67</a></sup>
                  and at the same time, reinforces the potential for womenâs
                  bodies to be clay-like in their materiality.

                  According to ancient written sources, the most popular
                  preparation was <em>cerussa</em>, a mixture of vinegar and
                  lead white,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn68" id="fnref68" class="footnote-ref-anchor">68</a></sup>
                  which was also a common ingredient in paints used to color the
                  faces of female Tanagras.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn69" id="fnref69" class="footnote-ref-anchor">69</a></sup>
                  White clay marl from the island of Melos, known as
                  <em>melinum</em>, was likewise used to make white paint and to
                  give a pale sheen to womenâs complexions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn70" id="fnref70" class="footnote-ref-anchor">70</a></sup>
                  Analyses of white pigments used in surviving samples of Roman
                  period cosmetics reveal common use of calcite and gypsum.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn71" id="fnref71" class="footnote-ref-anchor">71</a></sup>
                  Similarly, chalk dust (<em>creta</em>) was used in antiquity
                  both to brighten the complexion and to make sealings, which
                  carried the impressions of intaglio-carved signets, like
                  Ovidâs spray-drenched Venus, suggesting how the female face
                  could be similarly shaped and impressed with a new, more
                  seductive look.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn72" id="fnref72" class="footnote-ref-anchor">72</a></sup>
                  Taken together, we might think of women sculpting their faces
                  into plaster masks before painting them with added color.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn73" id="fnref73" class="footnote-ref-anchor">73</a></sup>

                  As Kelly Olson notes, the literary sources indicate that rouge
                  was the next most prominent cosmetic applied to womenâs faces
                  in antiquity.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn74" id="fnref74" class="footnote-ref-anchor">74</a></sup>
                  Roman authors mention red ochre (<em>rubrica</em>) and red
                  chalk as common ingredients.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn75" id="fnref75" class="footnote-ref-anchor">75</a></sup>
                  Like white lead, the former was also frequently used to create
                  the red paints used for Tanagras and other painted surfaces
                  such as wall paintings, including the billowing drapery o[f
                  cat. no. 6 and the [lips of cat. no. 5.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn76" id="fnref76" class="footnote-ref-anchor">76</a></sup>
                  Likewise, soot, ashes, and lamp black were used as kohl to
                  outline the eyes and darken the brows,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn77" id="fnref77" class="footnote-ref-anchor">77</a></sup>
                  just as carbon black was the preferred ingredient for black

                  As mentioned previously, the materials used to color the
                  vibrant costumes of Tanagra figurines were often also used to
                  dye the real fabrics worn by Hellenistic women, including
                  cinnabar, red ochre,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn79" id="fnref79" class="footnote-ref-anchor">79</a></sup>

                  The figurine of Nike Phainomeride (Nike of the Visible Thigh)
                  excavated in a tomb in Myrina and acquired by the Louvre in
                  1883 (cat. no. 6), wears a diaphanous pink <em>peplos</em> (a
                  robe with a distinctive overfold) that has been carefully
                  colored with a diffuse layer of pink-mauve paint composed of
                  madder mixed with lead white and calcium phosphate, applied
                  over a layer of red ochre. Bands of lead white decorate the
                  lower edge of the dress, delineated by thin lines of yellow
                  ochre.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn82" id="fnref82" class="footnote-ref-anchor">82</a></sup>
                  The effect here is not only to recreate the iridescent sheen
                  of fine layered silks, as worn by real women, but also to
                  suggest movement, enhanced by the luminosity of the pigments
                  and the play of light on their surface. On some Tanagras, such
                  as the so-called Lady in Blue (fig. 1),<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn83" id="fnref83" class="footnote-ref-anchor">83</a></sup>
                  the application of gilding to the borders of draped mantles

                  Even the binders that were mixed with the pigments to make
                  paint, as well as the varnishes used to protect and embellish
                  the finished surfaces of the Tanagras, find parallels in
                  ancient cosmetics. Both are rare to survive but were likely
                  composed of animal or vegetable gums, egg, and vegetable
                  resins,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn85" id="fnref85" class="footnote-ref-anchor">85</a></sup>
                  all of which are listed as ingredients in the ointments and
                  face masks women wore to smooth and polish their complexions.
                  To purify the face, Pliny recommends a wash of egg white,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn86" id="fnref86" class="footnote-ref-anchor">86</a></sup>

                  while Ovid offers four recipes for face packs that promise to
                  make a womanâs face âshine smoother than her own mirror,â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn88" id="fnref88" class="footnote-ref-anchor">88</a></sup>

                  It has long been recognized that the application of varnishes
                  to polychrome surfaces in antiquity aimed to enliven the
                  painted image by contrasting matte areas with shiny and so
                  creating opportunities for light-play and the suggestion of
                  movement.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn91" id="fnref91" class="footnote-ref-anchor">91</a></sup>
                  This was to satisfy the dominant aesthetic of
                  <em>poikilia</em>, a term used variously in Greek literature
                  to describe shimmering or dappled things and that conveys the
                  spectacle of intricately worked, polychrome, and
                  multi-textured surfaces.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn92" id="fnref92" class="footnote-ref-anchor">92</a></sup>
                  But where the application of surface polish to a Tanagra
                  figurine stimulated the senses through the play of light and
                  suggested movement, effectively breathing life into the
                  terracotta body, like another Pygmalionâs statue,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn93" id="fnref93" class="footnote-ref-anchor">93</a></sup>
                  it is clear from the written texts that to make a womanâs
                  complexion glossy was to reverse Pygmalionâs fantasy and turn
                  her into a glittering artwork, or, in Ovidâs words, a
                  shimmering image reflected in a mirror.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn94" id="fnref94" class="footnote-ref-anchor">94</a></sup>

                <h2>Molding the self</h2>
                <p>
                  Where it is easy to understand Tanagra figurines as miniature
                  facsimiles of the women who may have dedicated them in temples
                  or with whom they were buried, literatureâs emphasis on the
                  âmakeâ in âmake-upâ encourages us to turn the relationship on
                  its head and instead consider the female viewers of Tanagras
                  as facsimiles of the figurines. They, too, were massaged and
                  molded into ideal form, prepared, painted, and polished with
                  lotions and pigments, and finally adorned with costly textiles
                  and jewelry, posed and artfully manipulated to attract the eye
                  of the viewer and to suggest the desirability of the body
                  beneathâa body prepared for marriage and motherhood, to be
                  exchanged as a commodity between father and husband just like
                  any other artwork. As we have seen, this synonymy is
                  encouraged not just by the representation of contemporary
                  dress and the suggestion of familiar and idealized contexts of
                  behavior and action, but in the suggestive correspondence of
                  Tanagrasâ material and manufacture to cultural ideas about
                  womenâs physical ontologyâtheir earthy, malleable flesh and
                  mold-like capacity for reproductionâas well as in the common
                  ingredients of their painted decoration. We might even think
                  about the process of mechanical reproduction used to create
                  the Tanagras, by which multiple identical figurines could be
                  cast from the same two-piece mold (fig. 7), dressed in uniform
                  and with anonymous faces, as analogous to the cultural
                  production of a homogenized and collective female identity
                  that occluded individual character in favor of ideal social
                  roles (namely mother, daughter, wife, priestess), and that was
                  both achieved and understood through adornment.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn95" id="fnref95" class="footnote-ref-anchor">95</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  If adornment, then, was the process by which women made
                  themselves into artworks to be consumed by male viewers, then
                  the Tanagras should be understood as promoting adornmentâs
                  capacity to objectify the wearer. The figurines typically
                  stand on a low rectangular base (cat. no. 4), ostensibly to
                  stabilize the hollow form, but also to underscore the
                  terracottaâs status not as a representation of a real woman
                  but as an objet dâart, or better, as a representation of a
                  woman turned into an artworkâlike Pygmalionâs lover or another
                  Pandora. This potentially positions the female viewers of
                  Tanagra figurines as both willing participants in and products
                  of a male-imposed system of cosmetic control that sought to
                  satisfy male desire and diminish womenâs agency by indicating
                  their inherent falseness.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn96" id="fnref96" class="footnote-ref-anchor">96</a></sup>
                  Sarah Blundell has posited in her discussion of scenes of
                  female adornment on Athenian vessels, which were typically
                  used by women as containers for make-up, perfume or jewelry,
                  that female viewers had learned to be pleased by images of
                  themselves that were pleasing to men and that reproduced
                  dominant patriarchal views of womenâs roles,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn97" id="fnref97" class="footnote-ref-anchor">97</a></sup>
                  and subsequently sought to model their bodies in their
                  likeness. If Tanagras were designed according to male ideals
                  about womenâs appearances, and were in turn produced by male
                  artisans,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn98" id="fnref98" class="footnote-ref-anchor">98</a></sup>
                  then this also opens the door for them to appeal to male
                  viewers as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Recent scholarship, however, has argued for a more positive
                  view of adornment, seeing it less as a process of
                  objectification and more as a means of positive
                  self-construction. Olson has promoted a view of womenâs
                  adornment as âa deliberate act, indicative of both female
                  agency and a knowledge of the power of the visual, by which a
                  woman could communicate the self to others and infuse the self
                  with a sense of esteem and legitimacy.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn99" id="fnref99" class="footnote-ref-anchor">99</a></sup>
                  She suggests that we need to view women as knowledgeable
                  social actors who used adornment as a âcreative way by which
                  to exercise a means of authority and influence, a means to
                  become sexually and economically visible and attract
                  attention.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn100" id="fnref100" class="footnote-ref-anchor">100</a></sup>
                  For Leslie Shumka, the capacity to design and maintain a look
                  through makeup, jewelry, and dress was one of the few ways in
                  which Roman women could express themselves, and constituted a
                  different kind of craft, a means of shaping oneâs own
                  identity.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn101" id="fnref101" class="footnote-ref-anchor">101</a></sup>
                  She notes the prevalence of representations of toiletry
                  articles on Roman womenâs tombstones as evidence for the ways
                  in which womenâs personal ornamentation was viewed positively
                  by women as a vehicle of self-expression.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn102" id="fnref102" class="footnote-ref-anchor">102</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  This encourages us to look at the Tanagras as comparable
                  embodiments of Hellenistic womenâs capacity to manipulate
                  their own image and through it their identity. Like the
                  tombstones that Shumka discusses, the presence of so many
                  Tanagras in what were likely female graves implies a positive
                  association between these idealized images of femininity and
                  the women who viewed them. Certainly, the evocation of womenâs
                  public presence and religious roles, as suggested by the
                  Tanagrasâ dress, opens space for female celebration of womenâs
                  social visibility and their participation in the civic life of
                  the community. We have also seen how womenâs manipulation of
                  their drapery and their body language could be a means of
                  commanding attention, arousing desire, and communicating
                  wealth on a public stage.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn103" id="fnref103" class="footnote-ref-anchor">103</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  But where we might view this as evidence of womenâs acceptance
                  of the narrow remit of their public visibility, which was
                  limited by function and controlled by dress, Nancy Sorkin
                  Rabinowitz, in her discussion of Athenian vases, has pointed
                  to the ways in which images of women that promoted an ideal
                  look or behavior contributed to womenâs sense of themselves as
                  a community and subsequently to the establishment of a female
                  culture that prioritized female viewers (and hence also female
                  makers) of female bodies, to the exclusion of the male.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn104" id="fnref104" class="footnote-ref-anchor">104</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tanagras embody this potential for a self-supporting and
                  self-regarding community of women cast in each otherâs image.
                  Unlike the life-size marble statues of women with which they
                  were clearly in conversation, displayed publicly and seen by
                  both men and women, the contexts within which the terracottas
                  were viewed implies a more intimate and perhaps exclusively
                  female audience. It is unlikely that men would have frequented
                  the sanctuary spaces in which the female Tanagras were
                  dedicated, while the figuresâ small-scale restricted how many
                  people could look closely at any one time, facilitating
                  womenâs private contemplation of the female form and inviting
                  personal communion between image and viewer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If we accept the gendered associations of molding as a
                  technique, then we might also view Tanagras as female-made, at
                  least conceptually. This is further encouraged when we
                  consider that molds were sometimes cast directly from other
                  terracotta figurines, establishing family-trees of mother,
                  daughter, and sister casts, which evokes Hesiodâs description
                  of Pandora propagating the race of women, seemingly
                  independently of men.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn105" id="fnref105" class="footnote-ref-anchor">105</a></sup>
                  But the depiction of a female potter on the so-called Caputi
                  Hydria, an Athenian red-figure hydria attributed to the
                  Leningrad Painter, now in the Torno collection in Milan,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn106" id="fnref106" class="footnote-ref-anchor">106</a></sup>
                  provides tantalizing evidence for the real existence of female
                  artisans working with clay. This encourages us to consider the
                  possibility that at least some Tanagras were made by female
                  coroplasts, and making Geromeâs fantasy of a female-run
                  Tanagra workshop less fanciful than it might seem.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn107" id="fnref107" class="footnote-ref-anchor">107</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although we may in truth never know the gender of the artisans
                  that made Tanagras in antiquity, reframing these figurines as
                  female-made, female-viewed, and self-generated gives new
                  agency to their clay medium and to the perceived clay-like
                  bodies of real women. Rather than the passive product of an
                  artistâs hand, they become autochthonous, âborn from the
                  earth,â like Erichthonios, the mythical first king of Athens,
                  and so are intrinsically capable of endlessly recasting
                  themselves and their appearances. We have already hinted at
                  how the poses that the Tanagras strike and the ways that they
                  manipulate their dress enacts a kind of body modulation, so
                  that they sculpt their form by pulling, gathering, and draping
                  their garments into new shapes that echo the erotic curves of
                  the Knidia. That this is so often done with hands and arms
                  that are enclosed within the folds of the fabric that they
                  handle (e.g., cat. nos 3, 4, 5) reiterates that this is an
                  interior, autonomous action, a moment of self-craft that
                  encourages the Tanagrasâ female viewers to feel empowered by
                  the opportunities that adornment presented to engage in
                  self-production.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn108" id="fnref108" class="footnote-ref-anchor">108</a></sup>
                  If we take Sarah Blundellâs lead and recognize the erotic
                  frisson of images of women shown clutching their clothes,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn109" id="fnref109" class="footnote-ref-anchor">109</a></sup>
                  then we might go one step further and even see the Tanagras as
                  embodiments of the pleasures of self-expression through
                  adornment, which becomes a form of self-love once we
                  prioritize women as both the makers and the viewers of the
                  adorned female body.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Certainly, without a male audience, posing like Aphrodite
                  becomes a way of declaring oneâs desirability to oneself,
                  recalibrating the misogynistic view of adornment as a means of
                  cultivating the wayward female body instead into a model of
                  self-care. And it is worth noting here that many of the same
                  ingredients that were used for womenâs cosmetics and for the
                  decoration of Tanagra figurines were also used as therapeutic
                  medicines in antiquity.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn110" id="fnref110" class="footnote-ref-anchor">110</a></sup>
                  Even clay was a popular remedy for various conditions. For
                  example, Pliny notes that red clay from Lemnos was used as a
                  red pigment but could also be applied as a liniment or
                  ingested to counteract snake bites and other poisons, treat
                  sore eyes, and even to control menstruation.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn111" id="fnref111" class="footnote-ref-anchor">111</a></sup>
                  The clay was reportedly sold in sealed packages, formed into a
                  tablet known as a <em>sphragis</em>, or âseal,â and impressed
                  with a signet bearing the image of the goddess Artemis,
                  underscoring a material and functional relationship between
                  medicine, cosmetics, pigments, and objects of adornment,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn112" id="fnref112" class="footnote-ref-anchor">112</a></sup>
                  and implying an intimate connection to the female body.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Indeed, as Amy Richlin notes, the properties of cosmetics,
                  medicines, poisons, and even magic were frequently conflated
                  in antiquity as comparable crafts that aimed at âa certain
                  kind of control over the body and its surroundings.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn113" id="fnref113" class="footnote-ref-anchor">113</a></sup>
                  Unsurprisingly, for most male commentators, this reiterated
                  the danger of the cosmetically enhanced woman, whose
                  constructed appearance was not only untrustworthy but also
                  potentially harmful. But from a female perspective, we might
                  instead see the therapeutic possibilities of cosmetics as a
                  means of soothing and bolstering the self, either physically
                  or psychologically. With the medicinal uses of clay in mind,
                  Tanagrasâ draped and painted terracotta bodies go one step
                  further and promote adornment as a means of protecting and
                  healing the body, giving it a shinier, more powerful, and more
                  vital appearance.
                </p>
                <h2>Unmaking the self</h2>
                <p>
                  Tanagra figurines, then, not only offered an image of ideal
                  femininity to their female viewers, but also a model for its
                  construction that was contingent on the material possibilities
                  of clay and paint as substances intimately connected to the
                  female body in the Greek imagination, and of molding as a
                  method that was evocative of pregnancy and reproduction. If
                  the female body was a dressed body, then Tanagras suggest
                  possibilities for draping and adorning with jewelry and
                  cosmetics to be a means of constructing and even caring for
                  the self in a way that was empowering both in private and in
                  public.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Produced in multiples and perhaps viewed serially, they also
                  established a female look that enabled women to find pleasure
                  in their capacity to satisfy the male gaze, but more
                  importantly, also to find pleasure in their capacity to shape
                  a self that was visible, desirable, self-generated,
                  self-sustaining, and able to define womenâs sense of
                  themselves as a community. They also invite an embodied form
                  of viewing. By endlessly repeating the same gestures of
                  clutching, grasping, and manipulating their drapery, Tanagras
                  encourage their viewers to imagine the feel of different
                  fabrics and the sensation of moving within billowing skirts,
                  in a way that reiterates the pleasures of adornment, both
                  material and experiential.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But some Tanagras offer a riposte to this model of female
                  self-production through dress and demeanor. The so-called
                  <em>Titeux Dancer</em>, perhaps the most iconic Tanagra of the
                  nineteenth century,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn114" id="fnref114" class="footnote-ref-anchor">114</a></sup>
                  discovered in Athens in 1846 and widely referenced by numerous
                  artists of the period, exemplifies a popular class of
                  terracottas depicting veiled dancers that were found across
                  the Mediterranean from the early fourth century BCE (cat. no.
                  1).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn115" id="fnref115" class="footnote-ref-anchor">115</a></sup>
                  She is shown mid-pirouette, with her thin drapery falling
                  loosely away from her body in tumbling waves that swirl around
                  her ankles; her garment is so delicate and her movement so
                  rapid that it washes over breasts, stomach, and legs like
                  water, so that she appears almost naked despite being fully
                  draped. In fact, she looks more like representations of
                  maenads, the mythical female followers of Dionysos, god of
                  ecstasy, abandon, and altered states, who symbolized womenâs
                  wild, unfettered nature, and were typically shown in various
                  states of undress (fig. 8).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unlike her demure terracotta sisters, therefore, this Tanagra
                  offers an alternative to the strict control of dress and
                  deportment that conventionally defined womenâs social
                  standing. Hers is a body instead striving to free itself from
                  its drapery, and in so doing, redefines adornment as a
                  potentially de-civilizing force. It has been argued that these
                  veiled dancers depict female worshippers engaged in specific
                  ritual practice, which may, indeed, have been associated with
                  Dionysos and other ecstatic deities<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn116" id="fnref116" class="footnote-ref-anchor">116</a></sup>. They may also be professional dancers, perhaps performing
                  the <em>baukismos</em>, a spinning dance of Ionian origin that
                  is defined in the ancient sources by its grace, intricacy, and
                  sensuality<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn117" id="fnref117" class="footnote-ref-anchor">117</a></sup>. According to Julius Pollux, a Greek writer of the second
                  century CE, the <em>baukismos</em> was âa dainty type of dance
                  that liquefies the body,â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn118" id="fnref118" class="footnote-ref-anchor">118</a></sup>
                  while the cultic dances associated with Dionysos and others
                  offered similar possibilities for the dissolution of physical
                  and metaphysical boundaries and for release from all
                  constraint. This hints at how the fluid dress worn by the
                  <em>Titeux Dancer</em> and other terracotta dancers might
                  instead promote the potential for adornment to take the wearer
                  beyond even the limits of self-production: to be a means not
                  only of shaping oneself into ideal form, but of liberating the
                  self entirely from societyâs strictures and becoming
                  formless.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn119" id="fnref119" class="footnote-ref-anchor">119</a></sup>
                  Defined by their ever-malleable materiality, in this way,
                  Tanagra figurines come to symbolize models of both manufacture
                  and emancipation for the Greek female body and its female
                  viewers.

                        Production of so-called Tanagra style figurines is
                        generally considered to have lasted from 330 to 200 BCE,
                        with Tanagra and Thebes as major centers of manufacture.
                        The style originated, however, in Athens in the third

                        as much due to the tastes of nineteenth-century

                        Much scholarship on Tanagras has been concerned with
                        typology and iconography, that is, on pose, drapery
                        style, and attributes, useful for determining questions
                        of production, chronology, and social significance.
                        Little attention has been given to the materiality of
                        Tanagra figurines, beyond scientific analyses of theirâ
                        clay fabric and surface decoration, often for the
                        purposes of determining production techniques and
                        workshop locations. See for example, Brigitte Bourgeois,
                        âArts and crafts of colour on the Louvreâs Tanagra

                        Indeed, the perceived ordinariness of terracotta was
                        part of what appealed to the Victorian viewers of

                        According to Pseudo-Lucian (<em>Amores</em> 17), the
                        Knidia was so attractive that young men even attempted
                        to have sex with the statue.

                        As Dillon observes, concealing the body beneath layers
                        of sumptuous fabric, constantly manipulated to hint at
                        the physical form beneath, was also a stratagem deployed
                        by prostitutes in ancient Greece. This underscores the
                        potential ambiguity of female adornment and increased
                        female visibility, which made womenâs bodies hard to

                        the corset and from male control of female bodies; see
