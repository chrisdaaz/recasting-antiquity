                  <em>Recasting Antiquity: Whistler, Tanagra, &amp; the Female
                    Form</em>
                  surveys a series of works on paper by James McNeill Whistler
                  (1834–1903), the American artist best known for the poignant
                  portrait of his aging mother. These pictures are of a very
                  different order: although Whistler referred to them simply as
                  “draped &amp; nude figures,” scholars and collectors have
                  tended to call them “Tanagras” after the Hellenistic
                  terracotta statuettes unearthed in the early 1870s in the
                  necropolis of the ancient Boeotian city of Tanagra. The
                  figurines, which date to the third and fourth centuries BCE,
                  were brand new to the nineteenth century. As one antiquarian
                  observed in 1879, “Their principal charm consists in the fact
                  that they are completely different from any other antiques we
                  know.” Small in scale and informal in style, they typically
                  represent ordinary mortals rather than gods and heroes, making
                  them easy to understand and appreciate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ancient Tanagras depicting elegant young women tightly wrapped
                  in swathes of drapery held the most appeal for
                  nineteenth-century viewers and collectors. The related works
                  by Whistler, mostly lithographs, depict the female model
                  either nude or draped in semitransparent fabric. Despite that
                  salient difference, the modern and ancient works share what
                  Whistler’s biographer described as “the same flawless
                  daintiness, the same purity of pose, the same harmony of line,
                  the same grace of contour.” <em>Recasting Antiquity</em>, by
                  juxtaposing Whistler’s “Tanagras” with the objects of their
                  inspiration, invites consideration of the nineteenth-century
                  taste for the figurines and what it may reveal about changing
                  attitudes toward classical antiquity and conventional Western
                  notions of femininity.

                  <em>Recasting Antiquity: Whistler, Tanagra, and the Female
                    Form</em>
                  examines an important moment of encounter between the past and
                  the present, as played out in the work of the American artist
                  James McNeill Whistler. In examining Whistler’s
                  reinterpretation of ancient Tanagras, the Hellenistic
                  terracotta figurines that so captured the imagination of
                  Europe and America following their discovery in 1870, this
                  catalogue and the exhibition it accompanies consider the
                  ongoing legacy of ancient Mediterranean material culture in
                  Western art. More specifically, they question the ways in
                  which the classical female body, as an image and an idea,
                  persisted as a site for exploring issues of beauty, gender,
                  and art itself. Finally, the exhibition invites us to think
                  about the Tanagras in their ancient context, ultimately to
                  wrestle with what it means to represent and look at a female
                  body in any period of history, and how the female body may be
                  fabricated through the media and through the act of being
                  looked at.

                  For the opportunity to explore possible answers to these
                  questions, and to learn from her deep knowledge of Whistler
                  and his world, Ruth Allen is first and foremost profoundly
                  grateful to Linda Merrill, without whom this exhibition would
                  not exist. She has been a gracious, thoughtful, and inspiring
                  co-curator, co-editor, colleague, and friend.

                  The authors extend their thanks to artists Darya Fard, Matthew
                  Sugarman, and Ana Vizurraga, who contributed their time,
                  expertise, and creative labor to produce videos on lithography
                  and the two-piece mold process for inclusion in the
                  exhibition. Their work was wonderfully captured by Buff Harsh
                  and Duane Codrington. Ruth Allen is especially grateful to
                  Ana, with whom she shared many hours of conversation,
                  discussing material and technique, the identities of the women
                  who contemplated the Tanagras in antiquity, and the ways in
                  which this project affected our own feelings about ourselves,
                  our bodies, and our place in the world. We also thank Halle
                  Gordon, who offered suggestions on how to bring Tanagra
                  figurines up to date.

                  At the Carlos Museum, we are grateful to Renée Stein, Ella
                  Andrews, and their students Jada Chambers, Tyler Holman, and
                  Bobby Wendt, whose analyses of the Carlos’s own Tanagra
                  figurines garnered important results that deepened our
                  understanding of these objects’ materiality and context of
                  production. Todd Lamkin, Stacey Gannon-Wright, and Annie
                  Shanley masterfully coordinated loans, and Joe Gargasz, Dave
                  Armistead, Bruce Raper, and Ciel Rodriguez designed and
                  delivered a stunning installation, in collaboration with Mike
                  Nelson and Kirk Leitch at Times3. Thanks, too, must be
                  extended to Elizabeth Hornor, Katie Ericson, Kris Allen, Alice

                  She stands not much more than a foot tall, a figure with
                  flounced drapery made of terracotta and covered in polychrome
                  decoration that gives vitality to her dress and features.
                  Created during the fourth or third century BCE in Central
                  Greece, she is to modern eyes an example of idealized beauty
                  from the ancient world. In her original context, her role may
                  have been more subversive, capturing nuances of
                  self-expression through clothing and adornment.

                  She is part of a group of so-called Tanagra figurines
                  discovered in the 1870s, which played an influential role in
                  the reception of classical antiquity during this time. Their
                  portability allowed artists, among others, to study them and
                  trace their forms. This included the American artist James
                  McNeill Whistler, who created numerous works that were
                  inspired by the form, underscoring a key notion of history
                  that ideas permeate across cultures and time, influencing and
                  inspiring.

                  The exhibition
                  <em>Recasting Antiquity: Whistler, Tanagra, and the Female
                    Form</em>
                  is an important collaboration between the Art History
                  Department and the Michael C. Carlos Museum of Emory
                  University. The exhibition highlights two key roles the Carlos
                  serves as a university museum: It supports the research
                  interests of faculty through the use of its collections for
                  study and its unique ability within the university to bring
                  objects together from museums across the world, and it
                  provides a public face for the work of the university. This
                  exhibition and its related public programs allow audiences to
                  see firsthand the type of original research that faculty and
                  staff in the university undertake.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I would like to thank Dr. Linda Merrill, teaching professor
                  and director of undergraduate studies in the Art History
                  Department, for providing the inspiration for this exhibition.
                  Without her personal research interest in this topic, this
                  exhibition would not have taken place. I thank in equal
                  measure Dr. Ruth Allen, curator of Greek and Roman art at the
                  Carlos, for her work as co-curator of the exhibition. In her
                  capacity as expert in ancient art, she selected the ancient
                  Greek objects to include in the exhibition, and in her
                  capacity as a museum curator, she skillfully mediated the
                  ideas into a form that the public can see and understand with
                  clarity and purpose.

                    In the current fashion for Victoriana we may confidently
                    expect a revival of public interest in these darlings of
                    Victorian taste which also fascinated an artist like
                    Whistler.

                  <p>—R A. Higgins, 1962</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Just as the nineteenth century was tiring of the perfect poise
                  of Classical Greek sculpture, the spade of a Boeotian laborer
                  hit upon a new inspiration. Scores of ancient figurines were
                  unearthed from fields surrounding the ancient city of Tanagra,
                  humble objects made of clay, often bearing traces of painted
                  decoration, and rarely more than nine inches tall. The
                  statuettes were ancient, dating to the late fourth and third
                  centuries BCE, but to the Victorians, they were new. “Their
                  principal charm,” observed the antiquarian Frederic Vors in
                  1879, “consists in the fact that they are completely different
                  from any other antiques we know.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn1" id="page-1-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  Unburdened by inscriptions, allusions, or religious
                  significance (as far as anyone could tell), the figurines
                  seemed to be intended only to delight. Here, at last, were
                  antiquities for everyone, ancient objects that could be
                  appreciated without the benefit of a classical education. “The
                  remarkable side of the matter is this,” wrote Marcus B. Huish
                  in 1898, “that no one with instincts for beauty, or interest
                  in antiquity, or in the evolution of art can fail to be at
                  once captivated by these terra-cottas.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn2" id="page-1-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the Louvre historian Néguine Mathieux has remarked, “The
                  figurines appeared during an age that ardently yearned for
                  them.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn3" id="page-1-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  <em>Recasting Antiquity: Whistler, Tanagra, &amp; the Female
                    Form</em>
                  explores this episode in the history of taste. The Tanagras,
                  diminutively scaled, delicately tinted, and physically
                  fragile, were instantly adorable to collectors and
                  connoisseurs, exciting both “the covetousness of museums” and
                  “the sagacity of archaeologists.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn4" id="page-1-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  Moreover, they were confidently predicted to benefit the art
                  of their own time: “These terra cottas,” pronounced Charles de
                  Kay, “are object lessons in art which we cannot afford to be
                  without.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn5" id="page-1-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  Among the leading artists to fall under their spell was James
                  McNeill Whistler (1834–1903) (fig. 1.1), the American
                  expatriate painter, printmaker, and designer best known for
                  the poignant portrait of his aging mother. Between 1887 and
                  1896, at the peak of his professional life, Whistler created
                  images of classically nude and lightly draped figures that
                  reveal his fascination with the ancient figurines. The
                  lithographs in particular, impressions of delicate drawings
                  printed in ink on paper, have come to be called “Tanagras” for
                  their air of grace and gaiety, the very qualities that made
                  the ancient terracottas such treasured objects in the decades
                  surrounding the turn of the twentieth century.

                  centres in the dainty little ladies from Tanagra.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn6" id="page-1-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                  Although terracotta statuettes were manufactured and
                  distributed throughout the Hellenistic world, the findings at
                  Tanagra around 1870 were so extraordinary and unexpected that
                  the name of the site became indelibly attached to the entire
                  class of female terracotta figurines. Tanagra lies sixty miles
                  north of Athens, not far from Thebes, in the region of Boeotia
                  (fig. 1.2), “a name as readily misspelt,” Huish observed, “as
                  ill-pronounced” (Bee-OH-shee-a). According to Reynold Higgins,
                  a modern-day authority on Tanagra terracottas, Boeotia was “a
                  by-word in antiquity for clumsiness and stupidity,” and Huish
                  and his contemporaries could hardly believe that so gauche a
                  place could engender so much charm.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn7" id="page-1-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  In fact, the format and technology had originated in
                  fourth-century Athens, with figurines exported to Boeotia,
                  where the style was adopted and then perfected by local
                  craftspeople. By the third century BCE, Tanagra productions
                  were disseminated throughout, and even beyond, the Greek
                  world.

                  The figurines that particularly appealed to nineteenth-century
                  collectors were made in the early Hellenistic era, between 330
                  and 200 BCE. Although their subjects range from women and
                  children to actors and old men, the dominant type by far is
                  the standing female figure draped in fabric that falls to her
                  feet and usually enfolds her hands. These female statuettes
                  were “much prettier” and more carefully executed than the
                  others, according to the French archaeologist Olivier Rayet
                  (1847–1887), who supposed they had been assigned to the most
                  skilled of the mold-makers.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn8" id="page-1-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  In keeping with the fashion of the day, the typical Tanagra
                  figure wears a large mantle, or cloak, called a
                  <em>himation</em>—“<em>de rigeur</em> when a Greek lady walked
                  abroad,” one Victorian writer imagined—over a finely pleated
                  tunic called a <em>chiton</em> (fig. 1.3). In a variation on
                  the earlier, Classical style of draping figures, the thinly
                  woven himation is pulled tightly across the body, showing the
                  folds of the heavier garment underneath.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn9" id="page-1-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>

                  The hair of a typical Tanagra figure is intricately styled
                  (fig. 1.4)—one elaborate coiffure has been named by modern art
                  historians for a cantaloupe (see
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-3">cat. no. 3</a>)—and sometimes
                  covered by a kerchief, or a veil thrown over the head like a
                  hood, or a straw sunhat called a <em>tholia.</em> The figure
                  occasionally holds a heart-shaped fan, or a mirror, or even a
                  child, and usually strikes a self-assured pose, “as if
                  attentive to a speaker or an object of not over-exciting

                  Her facial expression is generally impassive, which to the
                  Victorians signaled a welcome absence of “dark passions”:
                  “Search through the entire known list of Tanagra ceramics,”
                  wrote Mary Curtis in 1879, “and you will not find a note
                  discordant with the expression of peace, gladness,
                  sportiveness, tempered with a mood of pleased attention, or
                  repose.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn11" id="page-1-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>

                  The artisans who created these quiescent figurines were known
                  as <em>coroplasts</em>, the Greek word for “modelers of
                  girls,” sometimes contemptuously construed as “makers of
                  dolls.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn12" id="page-1-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                  The scorn attaches not only to the domestic subject matter but
                  also to the medium (what Huish called “common mother
                  earth”),<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn13" id="page-1-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                  which lacked the prestige of marble or bronze. Nevertheless,
                  nineteenth-century writers generally esteemed the craftsmen as
                  “artists,” or at least “potters,” and naturally assumed them
                  to be male: “All these little figures,” writes Wilhelm
                  Fröhner, a Louvre curator, in 1888, “are of exceptional
                  beauty, created by men of genius.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn14" id="page-1-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                  The painter Jean-Léon Gérôme, on the other hand, envisioned
                  the coroplast as a young woman in
                  <em>Antique Pottery Painter: Sculpturae Vitam insufflat
                    pictura</em>
                  (“Painting breathes life into sculpture”), an image of a
                  terracotta workshop painted in 1893 (fig. 1.5). Gérôme’s
                  artisan is dressed in a plain white chiton of the sort worn by
                  enslaved servants in ancient Athens,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn15" id="page-1-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                  though it might also be the artist’s conception of an ancient
                  artist’s smock, or simply a means of distinguishing her
                  workaday clothing from the brilliantly tinted drapery of the
                  statuettes she makes in multiplicity.

                <p>
                  The production of a Tanagra figurine began with a prototype, a
                  statuette usually modeled by the artist in wax or terracotta.
                  Most Victorian writers presumed that these were modeled from
                  life in the fashion of modern sculpture, as “miniatures of
                  living men and women.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn16" id="page-1-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  “They are so human in their dainty prettiness,” wrote Hutton,
                  “that we realize at once that their type of beauty is not the
                  ideal one of the sculptor, but the real one of every-day
                  life.” A writer for the <em>Art Journal</em> went so far as to
                  imagine the Greek artist catching sight on the street of the
                  “elastic step and swaying robes” of one of the graceful women
                  of Tanagra, “who undoubtedly served as models,”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn17" id="page-1-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                  thereby transposing to antiquity the myth of the
                  Pre-Raphaelite “stunner,” a woman of such astonishing beauty
                  that the artist must persuade her to pose or die from
                  disappointment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It remains an open question whether the prototypes were in
                  fact modeled from life. Olivier Rayet could not believe that
                  the Tanagras were mere “reductions of grand sculpture,” when
                  they seemed so well adapted to the terracotta medium and so
                  comfortable in their diminutive proportions,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn18" id="page-1-fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>
                  yet modern scholarship suggests that they were probably based
                  on life-size statuary, or <em>archetypes,</em> such as the
                  so-called Large Herculaneum Woman (see fig. 2.2), made by
                  leading sculptors. The prototypes, however, were not simply
                  copies in miniature but adaptations, which elevated them “to a
                  high plane of creativity,” as the art historian Malcolm Bell
                  III remarks.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn19" id="page-1-fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                  As a writer for <em>Scribner’s Magazine</em> acknowledged in
                  1881, the coroplast was “no mere mechanic, no ordinary potter,
                  repeating impressions from the matrix given to him, but an
                  artist, with the soul of a sculptor.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn20" id="page-1-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  To create a mold, the prototype would be coated with wet
                  clay.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn21" id="page-1-fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  Once it dried to a pliable consistency, the clay would be
                  removed to make a concave template, retouched by hand. In one
                  exceptionally fine surviving example (<a href="#page-catalogue-2">cat. no. 2</a>), we can see how the inner surface has been treated with a
                  modeling tool to emphasize the fine lines of the drapery’s
                  pleated folds, the dominant aesthetic aspect of the figurines.
                  Finished in a kiln, a furnace for firing pottery, the mold
                  became the matrix in which the figurine would be shaped.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To make a figurine, moist clay would be impressed into the
                  mold in a thin, even layer; as it dried, the lining would
                  shrink slightly and release from the mold, whereupon the
                  coroplast would again work by hand to correct blemishes and
                  enhance details. “While the clay was soft,” the
                  <em>Art Journal</em> related, “either with a few bold, flat
                  strokes of some tool the ampler folds were made, or more
                  elaborate effects were brought about by an infinity of lines,
                  which reproduced the foldings and purflings of the
                  <em>himation.</em>”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn22" id="page-1-fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                  This intervention of the coropolast’s hand, sometimes marked
                  with a fingerprint (see fig. 2.6),<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn23" id="page-1-fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  brought the object “to a degree of perfection,” as Fröhner
                  observed, “which a merely mechanical process is unable to
                  give.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn24" id="page-1-fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                  This was a crucial point, for the Victorians needed to
                  distinguish the Tanagras, as mass-produced works of art, from
                  the modern gewgaws daily disgorged by factories in industrial
                  towns in the north of England.

                  The earliest terracottas in Boeotia were produced from a
                  single mold, with a simple slab in back, but around 330 BCE
                  the two-piece mold became customary in Tanagra workshops.
                  Thereafter, most Tanagra terracottas were sculptures in the
                  round.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn25" id="page-1-fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                  Separate molds were made for parts that would be added to the
                  bodies—solid heads, which proved to be almost
                  indestructible;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn26" id="page-1-fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>
                  accessories like fans, hats, and floral wreaths; and
                  projecting features such as arms and, occasionally, legs or
                  wings. Whether cast from molds or modeled by hand, those parts
                  would be attached to the figurine’s body with the creamy
                  mixture of clay and water called slip, also used to smooth the
                  joins between connecting elements. The hollow figurines would
                  then be settled onto a rectangular plaque, or plinth, and
                  vented in the back to allow moisture to escape and forestall
                  explosions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn27" id="page-1-fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                  The statuettes emerged from the oven as <em>terracottas</em>,
                  a term that means “baked clay” and refers to fired-clay
                  objects modeled by hand or mass-produced with the use of
                  molds.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn28" id="page-1-fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>

                  Unlike painted Greek vases, their “sister art” in clay,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn29" id="page-1-fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>
                  which underwent a complex, three-phase firing process, the
                  figurines were fired only once, at a temperature lower than
                  was required to create an impermeable pot. The potter and the
                  coroplast both relied on the kiln, and may even have shared
                  facilities, but because a terracotta figurine would never be
                  used like a krater or a kylix, it could be simply painted
                  after firing with water-soluble pigments. The figurine was
                  prepared for pigmentation with a coat of whitish clay called
                  kaolinite—a “bath of whitewash,” in Victorian parlance—applied
                  “to overcome the porous nature of the clay” and provide a
                  smooth ground for color. It could be seen “wherever the colour
                  has disappeared.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn30" id="page-1-fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>
                  The full <em>polychromy</em>—colors applied to ancient
                  pottery, sculpture, or architecture—would survive for only a
                  generation or two. Over centuries of burial, the pigments
                  inevitably crumbled or dissolved (see
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-5">cat. no. 5</a>), and according to
                  nineteenth-century accounts sometimes faded as soon as the
                  objects were exposed to the air.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn31" id="page-1-fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>
                  Nevertheless, from what remains we can gather, as Gérôme does
                  in <em>The Antique Pottery Painter</em>, how vibrantly, even
                  garishly colored the statuettes must originally have been.
                </p>
                <p>
                  According to Fröhner, much of the Tanagras’ popular appeal
                  derived from their “delicate flesh tint,” a warm roseate shade
                  that, for Victorian connoisseurs, may have recalled the
                  complexion of an English rose. (Oscar Wilde describes a
                  character in <em>An Ideal Husband</em>, 1895, as “really like
                  a Tanagra statuette,” “a perfect example of the English type
                  of prettiness, the apple-blossom type.”)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn32" id="page-1-fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup>
                  The typical Tanagra was adorned with blue eyes, rouged cheeks,
                  vermilion lips, black eyebrows, and reddish-brown, or hennaed,
                  hair. Although her shoes were usually hidden beneath her
                  drapery, those that could be seen had red soles, like the
                  Christian Louboutin designer items of our own time: those
                  striking soles are named as an element of the standard Tanagra
                  costume in <em>Le Costume Historique</em> (1888) (see
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-51">cat. no. 51</a>), which adds the
                  information that the shoes themselves were yellow, making them
                  resemble, Rayet reflected, the Turkish slippers of the
                  nineteenth century.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn33" id="page-1-fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The painters lavished their artistry on the figure’s garments,
                  highlighting their importance as markers of status and
                  sophistication.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn34" id="page-1-fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>
                  Popular shades were violet and mauve, pigments obtained from
                  the rose-madder plant, although the drapery might be painted
                  almost any color, as Henri Houssay observed in 1876, in “the
                  whole range of soft shades and broken tones familiar to the
                  painters of Pompeii.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn35" id="page-1-fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup>
                  We can see this clearly in another of Gérôme’s works,
                  <em>Atelier de Tanagra</em> (“Tanagra Workshop”) (fig. 1.6),
                  whose plummy palette was apparently inspired by that of the
                  figurines. The artist envisions the brilliant violet, scarlet,
                  and turquoise hues of drapery worn by both the figurines and
                  their consumers, while the coroplast, another woman in white,
                  is portrayed touching up a Tanagra figurine with color. Not
                  pictured here is the final, extravagant step for the most
                  precious figurines, the application of gold leaf to details
                  such as <em>fibulae</em> (brooches), earrings, diadems, or the
                  edging of a cloak, gilding designed to catch the light as it
                  glanced across the curves, braids, and folds of the female
                  figure.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn36" id="page-1-fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>

                  Just by tilting the head or turning an arm or adding a hat or
                  an ivy wreath, a coroplast could produce a variety of
                  figurines from a single mold, creating endless variations on a
                  theme. Although each was individually conceived, all possessed
                  “l’air de famille,” as Houssay remarked—a family resemblance.
                  A second generation would arise when existing mold-made
                  figurines were used as prototypes to yield new molds, thus
                  creating extended families, or “iconographic groups,” in which
                  the figurines might differ in size, due to shrinkage in the
                  kiln, but remain consistent in style, attitude, and
                  accessories. As the archaeologist Edmond Pottier famously
                  phrased it, “All the Tanagra figures are sisters, but few of
                  them are twins.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn37" id="page-1-fnref37" class="footnote-ref-anchor">37</a></sup>

                <h2>A new light on Greek sculpture</h2>
                <p>
                  Frederic Vors assumed, perhaps reflexively, that the Tanagras
                  had been “rather looked down on by the more æsthetic
                  Athenians,”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn38" id="page-1-fnref38" class="footnote-ref-anchor">38</a></sup>
                  a condescending attitude that has not altogether disappeared.
                  Over time, the prototype’s progeny—the mold-made
                  terracottas—moved away from the perfection of the archetype.
                  As the aloof manner of the Classical was tempered with the
                  local color of Tanagra, the figurines exhibited their own
                  idiosyncrasies and flair. It was precisely these departures
                  from convention that proved so endearing to Victorian
                  audiences. “They are summary, sketchy, suggestive,” as
                  <em>Scribner’s</em> described them, “often thrown into
                  disproportion by the shrinkage of the kiln, or by a chance
                  pressure of the potter’s hand. For perfection they have no
                  care.” Hutton insisted that their “sketchiness” was only “the
                  suppression of the unimportant,” and the
                  <em>Art Journal</em> defended their defects as evidence of
                  what the French called <em>l’art bon-enfant,</em> or
                  good-natured art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn39" id="page-1-fnref39" class="footnote-ref-anchor">39</a></sup>
                  Particularly in comparison to the severe, marmoreal splendor
                  of the Parthenon sculpture in the British Museum, the
                  terracottas of Tanagra offered agreeable interpretations of
                  antiquity, eliciting affection rather than awe. “An entirely
                  new light was thrown on Greek sculpture by the discovery of
                  the Tanagra figurines,” affirmed the American novelist Rupert
                  Hughes in 1896. “It robbed Hellenic art of its last claim to
                  frigid austerity, and credited it rather with the intimate
                  appeal and the warmth of humanity that were always the acme of
                  its endeavor.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn40" id="page-1-fnref40" class="footnote-ref-anchor">40</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The new light also reflected on the polychromy of the
                  terracotta figurines, which came as a delightful surprise to
                  the nineteenth century. For one thing, it helped resolve a
                  longstanding scholarly debate: because of their colorful
                  aspect, the <em>New York Times</em> asserted in 1890, “the
                  question of painting statuary has been settled, in so far that
                  we can be sure the ancients colored most, if not all, of their
                  statues.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn41" id="page-1-fnref41" class="footnote-ref-anchor">41</a></sup>
                  Even ancient descriptions of colorful statuary could be
                  dismissed without extant works to back them up, but the
                  recently unearthed figurines could not be ignored, even by the
                  “chromophobes.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn42" id="page-1-fnref42" class="footnote-ref-anchor">42</a></sup>
                  The <em>Times</em> critic, as it happens, was writing in
                  reference to Gérôme’s figuration of modern archaeology titled
                  <em>Tanagra</em> (see fig. 4.8), a sculpture that featured
                  several partial representations of terracotta figurines cast
                  in the muted palette of the nineteenth century, as though they
                  had just been pried loose by the archaeologist. Those
                  figurines served Gérôme’s allegory as material evidence
                  supporting the existence of polychromy in ancient marble
                  sculpture, instantiated by the painter in the monumental nude
                  figure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Moreover, as Brigitte Bourgeois observes, the polychromy of
                  Tanagra figurines had a positive aesthetic and commercial
                  effect: “It contributed to the impression of life emanating
                  from the clay figurines, and encouraged the late
                  nineteenth-century bourgeoisie in their dreams and craving for
                  an ‘imaginary antiquity.’” More than any other factor, color
                  allowed the figurines to seem “familiar and intimate,”
                  examples, as the <em>Athenaeum</em> said, “of what we should
                  now style popular art.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn43" id="page-1-fnref43" class="footnote-ref-anchor">43</a></sup>
                  This made it difficult to know how to categorize them. Rayet
                  attempted to force the “popular” antiquities into the canon by
                  illustrating them among “the most remarkable specimens of the
                  antique world” in <em>Monuments de l’Art Antique</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-52">cat. no. 52</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn44" id="page-1-fnref44" class="footnote-ref-anchor">44</a></sup>
                  They look out of place there, among such icons of antiquity as
                  the Borghese Gladiator and the Crouching Venus, and might
                  better be regarded, as the
                  <em>American Architect and Building News</em> suggested in
                  1879, as “the <em>genre</em> of classical sculpture.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn45" id="page-1-fnref45" class="footnote-ref-anchor">45</a></sup>
                  Although certain antiquaries objected to the use of an
                  expression borrowed from modern art,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn46" id="page-1-fnref46" class="footnote-ref-anchor">46</a></sup>
                  “genre” was a convenient term for classifying imagery that was
                  unusual for its very ordinariness, “portraits of the people in
                  their daily life, as they passed it,” as Marcus Huish
                  described them, “seated in their houses, or pacing the streets
                  in the bright sunshine.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn47" id="page-1-fnref47" class="footnote-ref-anchor">47</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>Scribner’s</em> cast the terracottas in a different
                  metaphorical frame, referring to them as “the every-day
                  report, the journalism, of Greek life.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn48" id="page-1-fnref48" class="footnote-ref-anchor">48</a></sup>
                  Some scholars persisted in looking for deities and legendary
                  heroes among the figurines, but it was generally agreed that
                  they were “merely idealized figures from daily life.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn49" id="page-1-fnref49" class="footnote-ref-anchor">49</a></sup>
                  In time, the relentless refrain of Tanagras as representations
                  of “ordinary life” and “ordinary costume” became a measure of
                  their monotony, and “when a fairly large series is seen
                  together,” they were regarded as “wearisome.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn50" id="page-1-fnref50" class="footnote-ref-anchor">50</a></sup>
                  Their interpretive possibilities were quickly depleted: unlike
                  the comparatively arcane imagery on Greek vases, for example,
                  about which a scholar might intone for pages, Tanagras did not
                  require any special erudition to understand or vocabulary to
                  explain. As one critic noted of an 1888 exhibition, “the very
                  remarkable collection of ‘Tanagra’ figures will appeal to the
                  less ‘cultured’ amateurs of Greek ceramics.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn51" id="page-1-fnref51" class="footnote-ref-anchor">51</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Perhaps as a corollary of their lesser position in the
                  hierarchy of art, many of the scholars who studied the
                  terracottas were female, at least in England. In 1891, when a
                  Miss Sellers gave a lecture on the figurines at the British
                  Museum, the <em>Illustrated London News</em> was moved to
                  remark that “the learned ladies sent forth from Girton and
                  Newnham,” the women’s colleges founded at Cambridge in 1869
                  and 1871, had done much to revive interest in classical art.
                  Moreover, it was “incontestable” that they had helped “to
                  popularize the fruits of recent discoveries among men and
                  women of all classes,” which is to say that they were
                  particularly adept at promoting Tanagras among the
                  uneducated.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn52" id="page-1-fnref52" class="footnote-ref-anchor">52</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of the “learned ladies” from Girton was C. A. (Caroline
                  Amy) Hutton, born in New Zealand, who used her initials
                  professionally to avoid being marked as female and thereby
                  regarded as an amateur—despite her honors degree in Classics
                  and a commendation of her “classical learning and artistic
                  discrimination” from the estimable A. S. Murray, keeper of
                  Greek and Roman Antiquities at the British Museum, in the
                  preface he penned for her

                  Ten years earlier, Mary F. Curtis’s name had not even been
                  imprinted on the title page of <em>Tanagra Figurines</em>,
                  although “Miss Curtis” was acknowledged as its author in a
                  book review.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn54" id="page-1-fnref54" class="footnote-ref-anchor">54</a></sup>
                  In 1900, Marcus Huish glibly ignored the hard work of his
                  predecessors, excusing his own uncredentialed entry into the
                  field with the assertion that until the publication of his
                  book, the only available resource in English had been a
                  chapter in Murray’s
                  <em>Handbook of Greek Archaeology</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn55" id="page-1-fnref55" class="footnote-ref-anchor">55</a></sup>

                <p>
                  If even accomplished Victorians could be rendered invisible by
                  their gender, it is little wonder that women in the nineteenth
                  century found pleasure and took pride in the Tanagra
                  figurines, images of female autonomy and self-possession.
                  “Life in Greece was lived by men,” announced one writer for
                  <em>Harper’s Bazaar</em>, referring to the silence in
                  classical literature on the daily lives of women, which made
                  it seem as though half the human race had lived for centuries
                  in seclusion. Here, with the Tanagras, were “representations
                  by which we might remake in our fancy the ways of life
                  belonging to women in general.” Indeed, as Hutton reflected,
                  quoting an epigram by Agathias, “Why do more than half the
                  Tanagra ladies wear hat and shawl if ‘they were not allowed to
                  breathe the outer air, and brooding on their own dull
                  thoughts, must stay within?’”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn56" id="page-1-fnref56" class="footnote-ref-anchor">56</a></sup>
                </p>
                <h2><em>Une joyeuse société</em></h2>
                <p>
                  In the nineteenth century, the “object or intention” of the
                  Tanagra figurines remained a matter of conjecture. John
                  Pentland Mahaffy, professor of ancient history at Trinity
                  College Dublin, cautioned that it was “necessary to suspend
                  our judgment, and wait for further and closer investigation,”
                  though he himself was inclined to adopt the theory that the
                  statuettes were made as children’s toys rather than fine art,
                  if only because the “minor” artisans who made them were called
                  dollmakers and “held in contempt by real sculptors.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn57" id="page-1-fnref57" class="footnote-ref-anchor">57</a></sup>
                  Evidence from Athenian tombstones appears to confirm Mahaffy’s
                  theory, though we now generally accept that the figurines
                  possessed “functional flexibility”— that they were used in
                  different ways at different times for different reasons.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn58" id="page-1-fnref58" class="footnote-ref-anchor">58</a></sup>
                  With a single object, “the house was ornamented, the god was
                  honoured, and the dead comforted.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn59" id="page-1-fnref59" class="footnote-ref-anchor">59</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The primary purpose of the figurines from Tanagra was probably
                  funerary, however, as the majority were found in the
                  necropolis, or cemetery. Yet unlike lekythoi, vessels made
                  specifically for “sepulchral purposes” and frequently
                  decorated with funereal themes, the Tanagra terracottas had
                  nothing of the mortuary about them.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn60" id="page-1-fnref60" class="footnote-ref-anchor">60</a></sup>
                  “With what intention,” wondered Rayet in 1875, “was this
                  multitude of figurines put in the burials?”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn61" id="page-1-fnref61" class="footnote-ref-anchor">61</a></sup>
                  Hutton pointed out that “the use of gay colors and cheerful
                  images in connection with the grave is singularly in
                  contradiction with modern views of death,” and she could only
                  reconcile the incongruity with the view that in ancient
                  Greece, the dead “cheered the dark passage with images of kind
                  and beautiful companions, and with symbols of vigor, of
                  sentiment, of action, and of mirth.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn62" id="page-1-fnref62" class="footnote-ref-anchor">62</a></sup>
                  Perhaps because the figurines were regarded with such
                  affection in the nineteenth century, this view of the Tanagras
                  as companions even into death gained currency. Mahaffy thought
                  the terracottas might attest to the human inclination to bury
                  beloved objects with a friend “that he might not feel lonely
                  in his gaunt and gloomy grave,” and Vors imagined them
                  enlivening the grave, which the Greeks associated with
                  immobility, by providing a “jolly little crowd of little
                  people—all full of action and life,” perhaps representing the
                  deceased’s kith and kin. To Rayet, the gathering was “une
                  Joyeuse société,” a joyful company made up of graceful women
                  and laughing children.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn63" id="page-1-fnref63" class="footnote-ref-anchor">63</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Reluctant to associate Tanagras with the tomb, the Victorians
                  were even more unwilling to relate them to religion. “Some
                  have argued that being found in tombs they must have a
                  religious intention,” the
                  <em>American Architect</em> reported, summarizing the state of
                  the field, “but the majority have come to reject this theory
                  and accept them rather as intended simply for ornaments.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn64" id="page-1-fnref64" class="footnote-ref-anchor">64</a></sup>
                  Archaeological evidence from Tarentum, a site in Italy,
                  contradicts that interpretation of Tanagras as “profane images
                  which bore no relationship to the sacred,”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn65" id="page-1-fnref65" class="footnote-ref-anchor">65</a></sup>
                  and even in the nineteenth century, commentators sought to
                  strike a compromise between the two positions: the terracottas
                  ended up as grave gifts or votive offerings but only after
                  enjoying a secular existence as beloved household objects.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn66" id="page-1-fnref66" class="footnote-ref-anchor">66</a></sup>
                  A. S. Murray, in a rare feat of imagination, pictured the
                  figurines “swept together from the walls when some important
                  individual of the house died.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn67" id="page-1-fnref67" class="footnote-ref-anchor">67</a></sup>

                  Even into the Roman period, the terracottas were intended to
                  decorate private houses,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn68" id="page-1-fnref68" class="footnote-ref-anchor">68</a></sup>
                  “to stand on shelf or in niche if not to be suspended on a
                  peg,” as Charles de Kay supposed: they were “the familiars of
                  the family without attaining to the dignity of household gods
                  or portraits of ancestors.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn69" id="page-1-fnref69" class="footnote-ref-anchor">69</a></sup>
                  Nineteenth-century commentators took delight in regarding them
                  as ancient knickknacks, objets d’art made to crowd curio
                  cabinets and mantelpieces in overdecorated houses (see fig.
                  1.7). Although coming from a period “of far higher artistic
                  attainment,” the terracottas could readily be related to
                  contemporary collectibles made by “the ordinary Italian or
                  French modeler . . . working in haste for a popular
                  market”—or, from the American point of view, “those gaudy
                  figurines that are sold in Europe to-day at country
                  fairs.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn70" id="page-1-fnref70" class="footnote-ref-anchor">70</a></sup>
                  Predominantly female, the terracottas were most frequently
                  compared to Meissen porcelain figurines, “the China
                  ‘shepherdesses’ of modern ware” (fig. 1.8). Such analogies
                  enhanced the Tanagras’ popularity as accessible antiquities
                  while undermining their stature and significance as works of
                  art. Murray, whose job was to acquire antiquities for the
                  British Museum, haughtily remarked that “the
                  <em>koroplathos</em> of Tanagra must have worked for a market
                  where there was less intelligence than what is called taste,
                  and when the wants of private houses were studied rather than
                  the public sense of true beauty.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn71" id="page-1-fnref71" class="footnote-ref-anchor">71</a></sup>

                  Jean-Lèon Gérôme better understood the “wants of private
                  houses” and the desires of common consumers. His
                  <em>Antique Pottery Painter</em> (see fig. 1.5) reflects a
                  contemporary conception of a coroplast’s studio, with an array
                  of “real” and imagined terracottas ranged on the shelves,
                  adjacent to a boutique that would not have looked foreign to
                  nineteenth-century shoppers (although the customers eerily
                  epitomize the figurines they purchase). The cleverness of
                  Gérôme’s conceit becomes apparent when we recognize that the
                  objects lined up on the workbench are anachronisms, images of
                  the artist’s own invention titled <em>Hoop Dancer</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-44">cat. no. 44</a>). The figurine derives from the prototype held aloft by
                  Gérôme’s marble <em>Tanagra</em> (see fig. 4.8) and may have
                  been inspired by an unusual (and fraudulent) terracotta of a
                  nude acrobat shown at the 1878 Exposition Universelle (fig.
                  1.9).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn72" id="page-1-fnref72" class="footnote-ref-anchor">72</a></sup>
                  Those pictured on the canvas, five awaiting polychromy to
                  order, replicate the artist’s own pastiche of a supposedly
                  ancient archetype, making the painting a riddle of
                  reproductions and originals, forgeries and authentic works of
                  art. <em>The Antique Pottery Painter</em> further functions as
                  a high-art advertisement of the mass-produced figurines, which
                  Gérôme offered in plaster and gilt bronze, commodities that
                  just might be affordable to those for whom an actual Tanagra,
                  to say nothing of an original Gérôme, would have been an
                  impossible luxury.

                <p>
                  With their tasteful swathes of drapery, the Tanagras may have
                  served in their time as three-dimensional fashion plates.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn73" id="page-1-fnref73" class="footnote-ref-anchor">73</a></sup>
                  From studying a figurine, one could learn how a Greek woman
                  dressed, “the shape, colour and fashion of her different
                  garments, and . . . with what infinite variety she arranged a
                  costume which, in itself, is extremely simple, and whose
                  elements never varied.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn74" id="page-1-fnref74" class="footnote-ref-anchor">74</a></sup>
                  A color plate in Auguste Racinet’s encyclopedic
                  <em>Le Costume historique</em> illustrates “Indoor and Urban
                  Costume, exactly as worn, here by Tanagran women” (<a href="#page-catalogue-51">cat. no. 51</a>)—the “Tanagran women” being Tanagra figurines, works of art
                  so true to life that they were considered to provide faithful
                  depictions of “the actual costume of their period.” Hutton
                  regarded their realism to be “the secret of their charm.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn75" id="page-1-fnref75" class="footnote-ref-anchor">75</a></sup>

                  If only Victorian women would dress as well, sighed the
                  <em>Saturday Review</em> in 1876, if only they, too, wore
                  clothing that “followed the lines of the form, instead of
                  distorting them—if graceful drapery were the first object
                  aimed at—there would no longer be questionings as to long
                  waists or short waists, crinolines, stays or straps.” If
                  examples of such elegant costume were not to be found in the
                  fashion magazines of Paris, then English ladies might avail
                  themselves of a visit to the British Museum, where they could
                  study “the exquisite draperies of the little Tanagra
                  terracottas, the most beautiful fashion models we shall ever
                  see.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn76" id="page-1-fnref76" class="footnote-ref-anchor">76</a></sup>

                  It was impractical to suppose that modern women could survive
                  in antique drapery, whatever its aesthetic quality, but it was
                  also naïve to imagine that the sumptuous clothing of the
                  Tanagra figurines, so consciously and skillfully manipulated,
                  could ever have been their everyday attire. The volume and
                  complexity of the drapery would have made it difficult for
                  women to use their hands for much beyond grasping the edges of
                  the himation, and they would have had to move at a slow,
                  deliberate pace to manage the voluminous folds of material and
                  avoid disturbing the disposition of the dress. “Given these
                  impracticalities,” Rosemary Barrow observes, “it is unlikely
                  that multiple layers of fine drapery were in everyday
                  use.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn77" id="page-1-fnref77" class="footnote-ref-anchor">77</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Contrary, therefore, to the Victorian point of view, the
                  figurines did not portray ordinary people fitted out in casual
                  clothing for everyday activities. They reflected not reality,
                  but an ideal. Because drapery is neither cut nor tailored,
                  “the beauty of the chiton and himation lay in the art of
                  positioning them around the body,” as Barrow notes, which
                  implies a certain level of sophistication to wear them well;
                  the figurines, therefore, may have modeled the way a perfectly
                  well-dressed, well-informed Greek woman presented herself in
                  public. Such women would have been members of the social elite
                  who dressed up in finery for special occasions—religious
                  ceremonies or festivals where they would have been expected to
                  display the family’s wealth and civic-mindedness.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn78" id="page-1-fnref78" class="footnote-ref-anchor">78</a></sup>
                  Another of their purposes, then, as Sheila Dillon has argued,
                  may have been to commemorate women’s participation in
                  religious rituals: collectively, the figurines can be seen to
                  represent “the world of women on the public stage.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn79" id="page-1-fnref79" class="footnote-ref-anchor">79</a></sup>
                  The implicit paradox of the figurines—images of women parading
                  their social status with ostentatious clothing, elegant
                  coiffures, and red-soled shoes while maintaining the modest
                  demeanor of well-bred ladies—would not have been lost on
                  Victorian women of the upper classes.
                </p>

                  If “the dainty little ladies of Tanagra” were elite, they were
                  nonetheless mortal, lacking the attributes that would identify
                  them as goddesses. Yet there were among the terracottas
                  depictions of the popular goddess Aphrodite, perhaps because
                  she held particular relevance for maidens and married women.
                  As Daniel Graepler notes of the Hellenic worldview, “The
                  borderline between the human world and the mythical sphere of
                  the gods is often tenuous.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn80" id="page-1-fnref80" class="footnote-ref-anchor">80</a></sup>
                  For the Greeks, the archetypical Aphrodite was the Knidia
                  (fig. 1.10), the masterpiece by Praxiteles and the first
                  life-size cult statue of the goddess fully in the nude—a
                  sculpture that created, all at once, the ideal of female
                  physical beauty.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn81" id="page-1-fnref81" class="footnote-ref-anchor">81</a></sup>
                  Terracotta Aphrodites sometimes allude to their illustrious
                  predecessor with their old-fashioned hairstyles, loosely
                  gathered in the back and with a center part; but what makes
                  them immediately recognizable—“évident au premier coup d’œil”
                  (“evident at first glance”), as Rayet writes in the
                  <em>Gazette des Beaux-Arts</em>—is their partially draped
                  condition.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn82" id="page-1-fnref82" class="footnote-ref-anchor">82</a></sup>
                  (Were they to be entirely “undraped,” as Curtis points out,
                  the figurines would be “less steady on their legs.”)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn83" id="page-1-fnref83" class="footnote-ref-anchor">83</a></sup>
                  In one common type (<a href="#page-catalogue-10">cat. no. 10</a>), perhaps adapted from a portrait statue of Phryne, the
                  courtesan of Praxiteles, Aphrodite strikes a pose relaxed
                  enough to hold for an eternity: her left hand rests lightly on
                  her swaying hip, her right on a pedestal, her legs crossed
                  casually underneath her skirt.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn84" id="page-1-fnref84" class="footnote-ref-anchor">84</a></sup>
                  If her facial expression looks stern for the goddess of sexual
                  love, the seduction resides in her swaggering pose, with the
                  drapery slipping far enough to bare her breasts but still
                  conceal her modesty.

                  Another goddess occasionally found among the Hellenistic
                  terracottas is Nike, the winged Victory. “They really do
                  appear to fly,” Lucilla Burn remarks, “their tall, beautifully
                  feathered wings extended, one leg pushing free of the drapery,
                  which then presses back in windswept folds against the other
                  leg and body.” Because of the projecting wings, the Nike
                  statuettes were especially fragile and may have been intended
                  especially for the grave, perhaps to signify the spirit’s
                  escape from its confines.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn85" id="page-1-fnref85" class="footnote-ref-anchor">85</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nikes became a specialty of the workshops at Myrina, a
                  settlement in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey near the town of
                  Izmir, formerly Smryna) that was probably established by
                  emigrant Boeotians who brought their molds and models with
                  them. Edmond Pottier excavated the site in 1881 and four years
                  later, when the terracottas were exhibited in Paris, they were
                  appreciated as “at once a complement and a contrast to the
                  lovely sepulchral terra-cottas of Tanagra.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn86" id="page-1-fnref86" class="footnote-ref-anchor">86</a></sup>
                  Indeed, the Myrina figurines not only supply the gods and
                  heroes absent from the Tanagra population but also manifest a
                  more complex polychromy, with colors layered or artfully
                  juxtaposed to enhance their luminosity (see
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-6">cat. no. 6</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn87" id="page-1-fnref87" class="footnote-ref-anchor">87</a></sup>
                  The Myrina figurines are further distinguished by their
                  remarkable “expression and energy,” as the
                  <em>Illustrated London News</em> observed, a departure from
                  the “dignified repose” of their Tanagra cousins.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn88" id="page-1-fnref88" class="footnote-ref-anchor">88</a></sup>

                <h2>In olive woods round Tanagra</h2>
                <p>
                  In one romantic origin story, the ancient artisan makes his
                  Tanagra terracottas of such “deathless grace and charm” that
                  they are fated to become the “playthings to his dead.” Buried
                  by their maker “in the tombs of his elders on the hillsides of
                  Bœotia and elsewhere,” they sleep peacefully, undisturbed for
                  centuries “until the pick of the archæologist and the
                  excavator on the yellow hillsides by Tanagra wakened them to a
                  new day and brought them forth.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn89" id="page-1-fnref89" class="footnote-ref-anchor">89</a></sup>
                  In reality, the unearthing efforts in Boeotia were heedless
                  and rapacious, an unfortunate episode in the history of art
                  and archaeology. The graverobbers so completely destroyed the
                  archaeological context—the evidence of the figurines’
                  arrangement in the tombs—that even today, these objects remain
                  in many ways a mystery.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Olivier Rayet, who was resident in Athens when the terracottas
                  first turned up, pieced together the story of the early
                  “excavations.” As a collector himself—a potential
                  customer—Rayet was able to communicate with the tomb robbers
                  and learn from them directly what was happening to the burial
                  grounds around Tanagra; as an archaeologist, he could make
                  sense of the situation and record his conclusions for the
                  readers of the <em>Gazette des Beaux-Arts</em> in 1875 (<a href="#page-catalogue-49">cat. no. 49</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn90" id="page-1-fnref90" class="footnote-ref-anchor">90</a></sup>
                  Graverobbing was not new to the Tanagra region, but it was
                  only in 1870, when some inhabitants of a village three miles
                  below Tanagra called Schimatari (“the place of statuettes”)
                  began exploring the earth beneath the vineyards covering a
                  nearby hill, that some curious little objects turned up.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn91" id="page-1-fnref91" class="footnote-ref-anchor">91</a></sup>
                  Word of the finds reached a professional excavator (or
                  graverobber) from Corfu named Yorghos Anyphantès, known as
                  Barba-Georghis (Uncle George). By December he had set to work,
                  finding that the ancient graves lined the roads leading out of
                  town, which allowed him to excavate the territory with
                  extraordinary efficiency.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn92" id="page-1-fnref92" class="footnote-ref-anchor">92</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The assiduity of Uncle George inspired scores of laborers from
                  surrounding villages, who helped him ransack the neighborhood.
                  They dug day and night to the utter neglect of the region’s
                  agriculture,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn93" id="page-1-fnref93" class="footnote-ref-anchor">93</a></sup>
                  plundering some ten thousand graves between 1872 and 1874.
                  Nearly half the tombs yielded nothing of interest, but some of
                  those in the dry, white clay of the hillside contained
                  figurines that were largely intact, with much of their
                  original painted decoration.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn94" id="page-1-fnref94" class="footnote-ref-anchor">94</a></sup>
                  As Murray points out, it was “from want of supervision at the
                  beginning, and perhaps in defiance of it since,” that the
                  illicitly obtained terracottas poured into private hands and
                  even museum collections, including the Louvre, which made its
                  first accessions in 1872. At length, the Greek authorities
                  dispatched troops to curtail the plunder, and the
                  Archaeological Society of Athens appointed a professional to
                  excavate what remained.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn95" id="page-1-fnref95" class="footnote-ref-anchor">95</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Greek officials continued to dig at the site until 1879, and
                  by 1881 <em>Scribner’s</em> could announce that “the
                  California-discovery day is over now in Bœotia . . . The white
                  lines of dry earth, thrown up from avenues of tombs bordering
                  the antique roads and intersecting the green vineyards and
                  yellow harvests of the modern Albanian agriculturists of
                  Greece, have begun to grow green again.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn96" id="page-1-fnref96" class="footnote-ref-anchor">96</a></sup>
                  The tombs had been thoroughly ransacked and the landscape
                  littered with the fragments of smashed vases. Even so, in
                  1882, Oscar Wilde, who was proselytizing the English Aesthetic
                  movement in America, wrote lyrically about “those beautiful
                  little Greek figures which in olive woods round Tanagra men
                  can still find, with the faint gilding and the fading crimson
                  not yet fled from hair and lips and raiment.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn97" id="page-1-fnref97" class="footnote-ref-anchor">97</a></sup>
                  Though out of date, his information came on good authority: J.
                  P. Mahaffy, who had been Wilde’s tutor at Trinity College
                  Dublin, and whom the writer considered his “first and best
                  teacher,” the one who had shown him “how to love Greek
                  things.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn98" id="page-1-fnref98" class="footnote-ref-anchor">98</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Published in 1876, Mahaffy’s popular
                  <em>Rambles and Studies in Greece</em> had detailed his first
                  trip, taken only the previous year.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn99" id="page-1-fnref99" class="footnote-ref-anchor">99</a></sup>
                  His name, already renowned, had opened doors to Greek
                  collections, and he found the newly excavated Tanagras in the
                  private homes of Athens “on cupboards, and in cabinets.”
                  Mahaffy was especially struck by their “marvellous
                  modernness”:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    The graceful drapery of the ladies especially was very like
                    modern dress, and they had often on their heads flat round
                    hats, quite similar in design to the gypsy hats much worn
                    among us of late years. But above all, the hair was drawn
                    back from the forehead, not at all in what is considered
                    Greek style, but rather <em>à l’Eugénie,</em> as we used to
                    say when we were young. Many hold in their hands large fans,
                    like those which we make of peacocks’ feathers.
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  For Mahaffy, the figurines attested to the versatility of the
                  Greeks in all matters artistic, “anticipating much of the
                  modern ideals of beauty and elegance.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn100" id="page-1-fnref100" class="footnote-ref-anchor">100</a></sup>
                  He was not alone in his tendency to turn this era of ancient
                  history into a reflection of the present day. Edmond Duranty
                  regarded the elegant poses of the figurines to be reminiscent
                  of Parisian coquettes, though the turn of their heads, he
                  believed, possessed a quality that was ineffably English.
                  Théodore Reinach characterized the typical Tanagra
                  lady—“always elegant but never affected, always in motion but
                  never in a hurry”—as “truly the Parisienne of antiquity.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn101" id="page-1-fnref101" class="footnote-ref-anchor">101</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  For prospective collectors, enchanted with these ancient
                  objects that somehow seemed as good as new, the figurines
                  could not be pulled from the ground fast enough. “Every
                  museum, every collection, public or private, made a point of
                  securing some of them,”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn102" id="page-1-fnref102" class="footnote-ref-anchor">102</a></sup>
                  and as early as 1876, fine-quality figurines were selling for
                  at least £40 to £60 apiece—six or seven thousand dollars in
                  today’s currency. Local laborers had been forbidden from
                  selling their finds “to private fanciers,” but examples could
                  be “secretly procured for much smaller sums,” according to
                  Mahaffy, “from persons who have concealed them for private
                  sale.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn103" id="page-1-fnref103" class="footnote-ref-anchor">103</a></sup>
                  Indeed, the black market for Tanagras flourished even before
                  the general public became aware of their existence. The
                  British periodical press first took note of what was happening
                  in Boeotia in June 1874, when the <em>Academy</em> published a
                  belated account of “the most exquisite terra-cotta statuettes”
                  emerging from the tombs at Tanagra.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn104" id="page-1-fnref104" class="footnote-ref-anchor">104</a></sup>
                  That November it was reported that a small number of “comely
                  Greek ladies” with “uniformly ‘carroty’ locks” had entered the
                  collections of the British Museum and the Staatliche Museum in
                  Berlin, with further additions to the former in 1876,
                  “remarkable for their almost perfect preservation, and for the
                  delicacy and refinement of the modelling.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn105" id="page-1-fnref105" class="footnote-ref-anchor">105</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Yet it was not until the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1878
                  that the figurines were given heightened exposure and a boost
                  in popularity. As Rayet declared in the
                  <em>Gazette des Beaux-Arts,</em> the exhibition “has won them
                  public favor.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn106" id="page-1-fnref106" class="footnote-ref-anchor">106</a></sup>
                  As evidence that they had remained until then virtually
                  unknown,
                  <em>The Illustrated Paris Universal Exhibition</em> describes
                  the terracottas as “curious,” or exciting attention on account
                  of their novelty, and refers to them as “figures, or
                  <em>figurines,</em> in clay”; the italics suggest that the
                  diminutive was still unfamiliar—a specialist’s or foreign term
                  (French, though derived from the Italian <em>figura</em>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn107" id="page-1-fnref107" class="footnote-ref-anchor">107</a></sup>
                  Rayet was impressed that the burst of popular admiration came
                  not only from those of educated taste, “but also among the
                  Sunday visitors,” the ordinary working class.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn108" id="page-1-fnref108" class="footnote-ref-anchor">108</a></sup>

                <p>
                  After their spectacular debut in Paris, demand for Tanagras
                  rose to a level where not even the black market could keep
                  pace. The <em>Athenaeum</em> reported at the end of 1890 that
                  some ten thousand specimens had been added to museum
                  collections,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn109" id="page-1-fnref109" class="footnote-ref-anchor">109</a></sup>
                  a number far exceeding the pool of genuine articles, earlier
                  estimated at about seven thousand. While intact Tanagras were
                  growing scarce, new Tanagras were made every day from
                  fragments “picked up and stuck together by the natives.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn110" id="page-1-fnref110" class="footnote-ref-anchor">110</a></sup>
                  Beyond the figurines cobbled together from bits and pieces
                  were brand new fabrications in the Tanagra fashion, created to
                  appeal to modern taste but wrought to look properly ancient
                  (see cat. nos. 12 and 13). “So perfect are the imitations,
                  even to breaking a statuette into twenty pieces to add
                  plausibility to it,” reported <em>The Times</em> in 1886,
                  “that there are said to be only three people in Athens who are
                  competent to determine their genuineness.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn111" id="page-1-fnref111" class="footnote-ref-anchor">111</a></sup>

                <p>
                  As early as 1879, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston accepted a
                  cache of twenty-two Tanagras “lately found in the Bœotian
                  tombs,” the gift of Thomas Gold Appleton and the only
                  collection of its kind then in the United States.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn112" id="page-1-fnref112" class="footnote-ref-anchor">112</a></sup>
                  Scarcely two decades later, “cultured Boston received a severe
                  shock” when it was announced that all but three of them were
                  “rank fakes.”

                    cases the original parts are so few, or so battered, that

                  Although some forgeries are so skilled that they can be
                  detected only by an expert eye or technical examination,
                  others are surprisingly easy to spot. After the Exposition
                  Universelle, it appears that the customary standing figures,
                  reticent and tightly wrapped, began to seem old-fashioned, and
                  some connoisseurs sought out figurines with more sensational
                  styles and stories. Their desires were satisfied, as if by
                  magic, with elaborate little groups of figures bearing
                  mythological subjects—the erotic
                  <em>Leda and the Swan</em> (fig. 1.11), for instance, or the
                  sentimental <em>Aphrodite and Eros</em> (fig. 1.12).

                  These wildly popular putative antiquities were “so extravagant
                  in their poses,” as Reynold Higgins observes, “and so
                  unconvincing in their subject-matter that it is surprising
                  that they deceived anybody.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn114" id="page-1-fnref114" class="footnote-ref-anchor">114</a></sup>
                  A few Victorian scholars did view the newfound works askance.
                  In 1888, for example, when some questionable figurines went on
                  view at the Burlington Fine Arts Club, the British antiquarian
                  Cecil Torr pointed out that “no terra-cotta of this class has
                  ever been found in any excavation conducted by any government,
                  or society, or responsible person.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn115" id="page-1-fnref115" class="footnote-ref-anchor">115</a></sup>
                  The catalogue could defend their qualities only on stylistic
                  grounds, noting that the sculptors in Asia (Myrina) “belong to
                  the romantic school,” an explanation that was supposed to
                  account for their more passionate expression. Murray lacked
                  the evidence to rule them out completely but dismissed the
                  newcomers “as foreign in spirit to all that is known of
                  ancient Greek art.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn116" id="page-1-fnref116" class="footnote-ref-anchor">116</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Among the most credulous of connoisseurs was Marcus Huish, who
                  had begun to collect Tanagras just before 1890, at the height
                  of the craze: of the thirty or so examples he reproduced in
                  his <em>Greek Terra-Cotta Statuettes</em> of 1900, many drawn
                  from his own and the well-known Ionides collection, at least
                  twenty-two, according to Higgins, “can be seen at a glance to
                  be forgeries.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn117" id="page-1-fnref117" class="footnote-ref-anchor">117</a></sup>
                  It is therefore no surprise that by the turn of the century
                  museums had begun to relegate their holdings to storage in
                  fear that their figurines might also prove to be fakes; for it
                  was only prudent, wrote Higgins in 1962, “to regard all
                  ‘Tanagras’ as forgeries until they are proved innocent.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn118" id="page-1-fnref118" class="footnote-ref-anchor">118</a></sup>

                <h2>Object lessons in art</h2>
                <p>
                  The <em>Athenaeum</em> prophesied in 1878 that of all the
                  antiquities on display at the Exposition Universelle, the
                  Tanagras would hold “the most attraction for artists”—and not
                  just for sculptors, as their surfaces possessed a parallel to
                  works in pastel or watercolor: “The general creamy tone with
                  the faint indications of delicate colour gives an added grace
                  to the exquisite forms.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn119" id="page-1-fnref119" class="footnote-ref-anchor">119</a></sup>
                  The following year, the <em>Art Journal</em> expressed the
                  hope that the terracottas would demonstrate, for those
                  Victorian painters prone to grandiloquence, “that daintiness
                  in Art can be arrived at with no possible loss of force.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn120" id="page-1-fnref120" class="footnote-ref-anchor">120</a></sup>
                  In a different era, the terracottas might not have appeared
                  relevant to the development of contemporary art, but
                  understood as decorative objects or drapery studies, they fit
                  the frame of aestheticism, the philosophy of Art for Art’s
                  Sake. Like the modern aestheticist artist, the ancient
                  coroplast “seems to have been guided only by his whim,” as
                  Rayet observed, “to have sought only novelty and grace.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn121" id="page-1-fnref121" class="footnote-ref-anchor">121</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  By the 1890s, the Tanagra figurine had become so closely
                  identified with refined artistic taste that Oscar Wilde
                  bestowed one upon Basil Hallward, the artist in <em>The</em>
                  <em>Picture of Dorian Gray</em>, as an emblem of his aesthetic
                  position.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn122" id="page-1-fnref122" class="footnote-ref-anchor">122</a></sup>
                  Whistler, on whom Wilde based the artist, did not himself
                  possess a single Tanagra figurine (he could not have afforded
                  one), yet his art naturally aligned with their style of grace
                  and beauty. Whistler was known for the delicacy of his color,
                  the economy of his line, and the daintiness of his touch.
                  Moreover, he consistently opposed the Victorian tendency to
                  measure the worth of a work of art in inches. Among his
                  artistic convictions was that a work’s size and medium were
                  inconsequential: to him, the critic Théodore Duret explained,
                  the Royal Academy extravaganzas which attracted public praise
                  were little more than “merchandise,” while little things made
                  from non-prestige materials—an etching, a paper fan, or
                  “terracottas like those of Tanagra”—could always be “works of
                  great art.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn123" id="page-1-fnref123" class="footnote-ref-anchor">123</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was late in the 1880s, just as popular appreciation for
                  Tanagras was reaching its height, that Whistler began the
                  series of works on paper which imply his own attraction to the
                  figurines. He never admitted to the influence, nor mentioned
                  the Tanagras in a meaningful way in any of his published works
                  or the eight thousand letters that make up his personal
                  correspondence; nevertheless, as Arthur Hoeber wrote of Bessie
                  Potter Vonnoh, another American artist who succumbed to the
                  Tanagras’ charm, “The influence may be traced, even if it be
                  not acknowledged.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn124" id="page-1-fnref124" class="footnote-ref-anchor">124</a></sup>
                  Whistler’s delicate drawings are made from the same two or
                  three professional models, just as the Tanagra figurines
                  derive from a finite set of molds; they also adopt a similar
                  repertoire of lively but casual poses—standing, seated,
                  leaning, reclining, draping, dancing—as if to modernize the
                  notion of the classical female figure.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn125" id="page-1-fnref125" class="footnote-ref-anchor">125</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Many of the same connoisseurs who pursued Tanagra figurines
                  had a taste for Whistler’s draped figures. The New York
                  collectors Louisine and Henry O. Havemeyer, for example,
                  bought an impression of the rare color lithograph
                  <em>Draped Figure, Reclining</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-31">cat. no. 31</a>) around the same time they purchased a dozen or so
                  purportedly ancient figurines from the renowned Spitzer
                  collection (see fig. 1.13).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn126" id="page-1-fnref126" class="footnote-ref-anchor">126</a></sup>
                  Marcus Huish, the self-proclaimed authority on Tanagra
                  figurines, was also the director of the Fine Art Society in
                  London, and in that capacity organized a groundbreaking
                  retrospective of Whistler’s lithographs in 1895. And the
                  artist’s lifelong friend Alexander A. Ionides, also a patron
                  of Whistler’s art, assembled one of earliest and most
                  important collections of Tanagra figurines in England. We
                  might, then, expect Whistler to have taken inspiration from
                  the actual terracottas he could have seen in person, either in
                  the collections of his friends or the galleries of the Louvre
                  or the British Museum. Yet we should not overlook the probable
                  importance of the illustrations of Tanagra figurines
                  proliferating in contemporary books and periodicals. It is
                  surely significant that Whistler’s only extant drawing of a
                  Tanagra (fig. 1.14)—the mere adumbration of a figurine—was
                  based not on an actual terracotta, but on a photograph of one
                  (fig. 1.15), an image of an object already transposed into two
                  dimensions and translated into black and white.

                  Although that sketch was never intended for public view—it
                  remains hidden away on the cardboard backing of another
                  photograph in a private album—Whistler’s improvisatory
                  drawings on the Tanagra theme were meant to be multiplied,
                  primarily in the form of lithographs. To understand why he
                  chose that medium instead of etching, in which he was already
                  well established, we might compare two illustrations of
                  Tanagra figurines made by different printmaking processes.
                  Both were published in a single volume of the
                  <em>Gazette archéologique:</em> one is a steel engraving (an
                  <em>intaglio,</em> or incised design on a metal plate, like an
                  etching) of a seated Tanagra figurine (fig. 1.16); the second
                  (fig. 1.17), of a pair of standing figures, is a lithograph
                  made by a young student of Gérôme who styled himself P-A-J
                  Dagnan, but later became known as the painter Pascal
                  Dagnan-Bouveret (1852–1929).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn127" id="page-1-fnref127" class="footnote-ref-anchor">127</a></sup>
                  The engraving appears linear and hard-edged, conveying the
                  “austere severity” and stony permanence associated with the
                  High Classical style: nothing about the picture suggests that
                  the figure is small in scale or made from clay. Dagnan’s
                  lithograph, on the other hand, retains the softness of his
                  original sketch, probably made with a greasy lithographic
                  crayon on a smooth limestone slab. Even in black and white,
                  the medium renders a sensitive translation of the tiny,
                  fragile terracotta figurines, lightly dusted with ephemeral
                  pigments.

                <p>
                  Beyond its use for illustrations, lithography was put to work
                  in the nineteenth century in the profitable business of
                  reproducing paintings for a popular market. In that respect,
                  the medium finds a parallel in the Tanagra terracottas.
                  “Suppose we regard them as popular editions of works by
                  masters,” wrote Charles de Kay, “suited, by the material in
                  which they are fashioned and the methods used to fashion them,
                  to the slender purses of the people.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn128" id="page-1-fnref128" class="footnote-ref-anchor">128</a></sup>
                  Whistler may have recognized that the Tanagras, as works of
                  art, transcended their commercial aspect, just as he saw the
                  potential of lithography as a means of original artistic
                  expression. In his hands, one journalist remarked in 1895,
                  “the despised art of the stone long in commercial bondage is
                  again set free for the artist’s service.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn129" id="page-1-fnref129" class="footnote-ref-anchor">129</a></sup>
                  Moreover, his meticulous attention to details of paper and
                  printing transformed the commonplace “litho” into a precious
                  object.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nevertheless, Whistler failed to achieve the success he
                  expected when adopting a medium more accessible and
                  inexpensive than oil or etching. In the popular sphere, the
                  “daintiness” of his style worked against him: his subject
                  matter, distilled to its essence, appeared too slight, the
                  drawing too cursory, to justify the cost even of a
                  lithographic print.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn130" id="page-1-fnref130" class="footnote-ref-anchor">130</a></sup>
                  More consequentially, perhaps, Whistler’s Tanagras challenged
                  the norms of Victorian propriety. In a crucial departure from
                  the modestly draped Tanagra figurines, his Tanagra-esque
                  figures are mostly, and sometimes entirely, nude. He did away
                  with opaque drapery as a means of liberating figures he
                  intended to embody the unencumbered spirit of art. What he
                  discovered was that, especially in America, “a nude figure
                  suggests at once the absence of clothes—and general
                  impropriety—only!” His New York dealer informed him that
                  <em>Cameo, No. 1</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-39">cat. no. 39</a>), for example, could not be sold at the price Whistler set
                  “because of the thinness of the drapery.” Indeed, the model’s
                  bare leg is fully exposed as she sits on the side of the bed
                  to bend and kiss a sleeping child—an innocent image if ever
                  there was one, but objectionable to a nation, Whistler
                  observed, “that requires the legs of the piano to be
                  draped.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn131" id="page-1-fnref131" class="footnote-ref-anchor">131</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although Whistler’s Tanagras, primarily executed as
                  lithographs and pastels, imply an interest confined to works
                  on paper, an episode in the early 1880s suggests that the
                  artist may have explored the medium of small-scale sculpture,
                  if only in terms of polychromy. The evidence is a photograph
                  taken in Whistler’s London studio in 1881 (fig. 1.18), which
                  shows a modern statuette of a female figure standing no more
                  than eight inches high, though elevated to become part of the
                  circle of friends: the gathering includes Whistler and
                  Frederick Lawless, the Irish sculptor who set up the
                  photograph; Frank Miles, an English society painter who lived
                  across the street; and the two talented sons of the American
                  neoclassical sculptor William Wetmore Story—Julian, a painter,
                  and Waldo, a sculptor, who happened to be visiting London that
                  year from Rome.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn132" id="page-1-fnref132" class="footnote-ref-anchor">132</a></sup>
                  Made at the time of the terracotta craze and similar in stance
                  and size to a Tanagra statuette, the figurine seems to have
                  been only one in a series of plaster statuettes striking
                  haughty poses and wearing stylish clothing—“charming little
                  swaggerers,” as Whistler referred to them in a letter,
                  “looking prettier than ever.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn133" id="page-1-fnref133" class="footnote-ref-anchor">133</a></sup>

                  When the figurines were eventually packed up and sent home to
                  Waldo Story, Whistler referred to them fondly as “tokens of
                  our work in the studio together,” which suggests a degree of
                  collaboration.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn134" id="page-1-fnref134" class="footnote-ref-anchor">134</a></sup>
                  It is reasonable to assume that Story modeled the figure
                  (shaped it in plaster) and Whistler dressed it with paint;
                  Lawless recollected twenty years later that Whistler had made
                  the figurine himself, though no one else could remember the
                  artist ever trying his hand at sculpture.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn135" id="page-1-fnref135" class="footnote-ref-anchor">135</a></sup>
                  Margaret F. MacDonald also gives Whistler full credit, citing
                  his convincingly comparable, contemporary watercolors of
                  fashionable young women in “swaggering” attitudes,
                  particularly
                  <a href="#page-https-www-metmuseum-org-art-collection-search-13245" target="_blank"><em>Lady in Gray</em></a>, of a model who holds a large picture-hat in a similar
                  position to the figure in the photograph.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn136" id="page-1-fnref136" class="footnote-ref-anchor">136</a></sup>
                  The physical evidence that might have settled the question was
                  lost when the “lovely figurines,” though carefully packed,
                  arrived in Rome in pieces.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn137" id="page-1-fnref137" class="footnote-ref-anchor">137</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In a way that Whistler’s works on paper do not, Story’s little
                  figure looks quaint, almost certainly because of her
                  contemporary dress. In his Tanagra lithographs and pastels,
                  Whistler was able to effectively avoid the trammels of
                  Victorian fashion, which proved particularly exasperating to
                  sculptors of his time. “The freer garb of classic maidenhood
                  presented easier and more inspiring problems to the ancient
                  masters of clay and stone,” wrote Hoeber in 1897, who dearly
                  hoped that “the hideous fashionable dress of the present may
                  by proper treatment be softened and mitigated.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn138" id="page-1-fnref138" class="footnote-ref-anchor">138</a></sup>
                  Bessie Potter Vonnoh, looking back on the last decades of the
                  nineteenth century, recalled the difficulty of trying to
                  accommodate the “atrocious fashions of the day”—“balloon
                  sleeves, pinched waists, full skirts, funny little hats”—
                  especially on the small scale in which she worked. Although
                  she sometimes depicted modern women in the costume of an
                  earlier, more graceful era, as in the bronze
                  <em>Girl Dancing</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-46">cat. no. 46</a>), Vonnoh rarely resorted to classical drapery. Greek
                  sculpture held little appeal for her. What she wanted, she
                  said, was “to catch the joy and swing of modern American life,
                  using the methods of the Greeks but not their
                  subject-matter.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn139" id="page-1-fnref139" class="footnote-ref-anchor">139</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tanagra figurines were gaining popularity in the United States
                  just as Vonnoh was coming into her own as a sculptor. They
                  obviously provided a congenial model for her work, yet she
                  initially denied their influence because, according to Julie
                  Aronson, “they subverted her self-image as a pioneering
                  recorder of modern life in a modern idiom.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn140" id="page-1-fnref140" class="footnote-ref-anchor">140</a></sup>
                  Eventually, Vonnoh acknowledged her own efforts to capture
                  what one contemporary journalist called “the spirit of the
                  Tanagra statuette, translated into the idiom of the Twentieth
                  Century.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn141" id="page-1-fnref141" class="footnote-ref-anchor">141</a></sup>
                  Although her statuettes were somewhat larger than the average
                  Tanagra figurine and their facial features more defined, “the
                  fundamental idea and the manner of treatment,” noted the
                  critic Helen Zimmern, “are <em>mutatis mutandis</em> the
                  same”: there were differences between them, in other words,
                  but only because certain aspects had to be altered.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn142" id="page-1-fnref142" class="footnote-ref-anchor">142</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Vonnoh’s <em>Girl Dancing</em> adapts a traditional Tanagra
                  theme that was also the modern one of a young woman dressed up
                  for a quadrille, and “somehow brings to the gazer’s mind,” the
                  critic Elizabeth Semple remarked, “a vivid sense of what is
                  meant by the phrase 'poetry of motion.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn143" id="page-1-fnref143" class="footnote-ref-anchor">143</a></sup>
                  <em>The Fan</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-47">cat. no. 47</a>)
                  transports another Tanagra model of femininity into the modern
                  age with a pensive young woman in a fashionable tea gown
                  standing with an open feather fan at her side. This figurine
                  is an extremely rare surviving example—one of three—of
                  Vonnoh’s work in terracotta,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn144" id="page-1-fnref144" class="footnote-ref-anchor">144</a></sup>
                  which she took up around 1910, experimenting with different
                  types of clay and degrees of firing and even acquiring a kiln
                  of her own. “Of all the work I have ever done,” she said, the
                  terracottas best reflected her ambition “to have each figure
                  as complete an example of personal work as a picture is of
                  that of the painter.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn145" id="page-1-fnref145" class="footnote-ref-anchor">145</a></sup>

                  An undated photograph of Bessie Potter Vonnoh shows the
                  sculptor dressed in an artist’s smock, seated in the studio,
                  lost in admiration of one of her own figurines (fig. 1.19).
                  Although the circumstances of the photograph are unknown,
                  Vonnoh appears to have fallen, perhaps ironically, into what
                  had become, by the turn of the century, a visual trope in
                  American art. The archetype may be Gérôme’s female coroplast:
                  Vonnoh, too, is the creator of the work of art she
                  contemplates, of which copies would be made for the
                  marketplace. Other American works on the theme show
                  well-dressed modern women passively appreciating objects of
                  ancient artistry: <em>Tanagra</em> (1901) by Elliott
                  Daingerfield (fig. 1.20), <em>The Tanagra</em> (by 1909) by
                  Thomas Anshutz (fig. 4.13), and

                  A late example of the theme is
                  <em>Tanagra (The Builders)</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-45">cat. no. 45</a>) by the American Impressionist Childe Hassam (1859–1935).
                  Its two-part title, considered by the contemporary critic
                  Royal Cortissoz “only nominally relevant,”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn147" id="page-1-fnref147" class="footnote-ref-anchor">147</a></sup>
                  may express the artist’s ambivalence about the premise of the
                  painting, which he defined in 1920 as a “blonde Aryan girl
                  holding a Tanagra figurine.” We can just see “the builders”
                  through the top-floor window of the New York apartment; the
                  secondary theme of urban progress is symbolized, according to
                  Hassam, by the Chinese lilies, “springing up from the
                  bulbs.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn148" id="page-1-fnref148" class="footnote-ref-anchor">148</a></sup>
                  Yet the figurine is not a Tanagra at all. It may be a replica
                  in miniature of a Greco-Roman Venus, perhaps made of faïence
                  or colored marble of the kind one might purchase in a souvenir
                  shop. More consistent with the Tanagra type is the life-size
                  figure with the Archaic smile, an overgrown example wearing a
                  Knidian hairstyle and a draping negligée. Her chalky
                  complexion and pallid features suggest a fading polychromy;
                  her disproportionately long left arm might be appropriated
                  from a different figurine, or else dislocated from its socket,
                  as it turns from the elbow at an unnatural angle.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The figure stands wedged between a polished mahogany table and
                  a Japanese folding screen, whose vivid colors and patterns are
                  abstracted and dimly reflected in her filmy garment so that
                  she appears pinned to the décor. The tall window offers no
                  escape, as a table has been set in front of it for the purpose
                  of forcing the paperwhite bulbs; sheer curtains have been
                  pulled aside to admit daylight and reveal the view, with only
                  a high, pale rectangle of sky representing the natural world.
                  The oppressive air of <em>Tanagra (The Builders)</em> belies
                  the optimistic message Hassam claims to have intended, “the
                  groth [<em>sic</em>] of a great city.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn149" id="page-1-fnref149" class="footnote-ref-anchor">149</a></sup>
                  The layers of culture confining the figure may be meant to
                  buffer the shock of the modern—the outside world that had
                  recently entered the First World War. Perhaps the artist
                  regarded the so-called Tanagra figurine as an emblem of
                  Western civilization, which the “Aryan” woman holds out like a
                  talisman against the inevitability of change.
                </p>
                <h2>Conversing with the past</h2>
                <p>
                  For the ancient Greeks who made and consumed the Tanagra
                  figurines, the terracottas represented the feminine ideal, “a
                  well-dressed, mature woman . . . valued in the home, in the
                  sanctuary, and in the afterlife.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn150" id="page-1-fnref150" class="footnote-ref-anchor">150</a></sup>
                  For the late Victorian scholars who studied and collected
                  them, they reconfigured their concept of antique statuary,
                  casting it in living color and offering access to “a Greece
                  they could feel close to, . . . a Greece that was already
                  bourgeois.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn151" id="page-1-fnref151" class="footnote-ref-anchor">151</a></sup>
                  But after the turn of the twentieth century, the Tanagras
                  began to lose their glamour. They were dispersed from private
                  collections and removed from museum displays out of a combined
                  fear of forgery and antipathy toward Victorian taste. The term
                  “Tanagra,” however, lived on, and expanded to embrace the new
                  movement of women’s liberation. The Italian feminist Rosa
                  Genoni (1867–1954), an outspoken opponent of the first World
                  War and the Fascist regime, designed the
                  <a href="#page-https-vestoj-com-draping-the-feminist-revolution" target="_blank">Tanagra Dress</a>
                  in 1908 to wear when addressing the first Italian National
                  Congress of Women. Challenging the contemporary taste for
                  closely tailored styles, the dress balanced “the stitched and
                  the draped,” as the fashion historian Eugenia Paulicelli has
                  noted, and made “a statement of a strong female identity and
                  personality.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn152" id="page-1-fnref152" class="footnote-ref-anchor">152</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In <em>The Modern Parisienne</em> of 1912, Octave Uzanne
                  writes that “the lady of society” had at last achieved the
                  freedom to choose how she “set off her elegance and beauty”
                  while at home: “She has rediscovered the art of drapery, of
                  arranging materials of harmonious folds, and sometimes
                  delights to wrap herself in clinging gauzy stuffs like the
                  delicious Tanagra statuettes.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn153" id="page-1-fnref153" class="footnote-ref-anchor">153</a></sup>
                  That new attitude toward tailoring became public in 1913, with
                  a new “silhouette à la mode” predicated on a misunderstanding
                  of Tanagra drapery as “drawn up in front and low at the back”
                  (fig. 1.21).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn154" id="page-1-fnref154" class="footnote-ref-anchor">154</a></sup>
                  Although the new fashion was adopted by Parisian ladies as
                  markers of their modernity, they still felt compelled, as the
                  writer Colette noted in her memoirs, to wear a long “Tanagra
                  corset” underneath, lest their loose garb reflect upon their
                  morals.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn155" id="page-1-fnref155" class="footnote-ref-anchor">155</a></sup>
                  The liberating connotations of the term “Tanagra” were also
                  cast on the art of dance, most famously in Martha Graham’s
                  debut performance as a choreographer in 1926. In
                  <em>Tanagra,</em> Graham (1894–1991) appeared on stage as a
                  figurine in motion, “a Greek figure with a fan, who handled
                  her soft draperies deftly and made beautiful pictures against
                  the black back-drop” (fig. 1.22).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn156" id="page-1-fnref156" class="footnote-ref-anchor">156</a></sup>

                  Like all popular manias, the enthusiasm for Tanagra figurines,
                  and even for the lilting tone of the word itself, eventually
                  faded away. During the postwar period, the terracottas all but
                  disappeared from view, except to the scholars who studied
                  them, and even they were discomfited by the Tanagras’ easy
                  charm: in 1948, one classicist belittled them in his book on

                  Although Reynold Higgins confidently expected a revival of the
                  taste for them as part of the resurgence of Victoriana in the
                  1960s,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn158" id="page-1-fnref158" class="footnote-ref-anchor">158</a></sup>
                  the twentieth century, it seems, took little notice of the
                  ancient terracottas.

                  It was only in 2003 that the figurines returned to the
                  limelight, introduced to the new millennium with
                  <em>Tanagra: Mythe et archéologie</em>, an exhibition
                  organized by the Louvre and the Montreal Museum of Fine
                  Arts.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn159" id="page-1-fnref159" class="footnote-ref-anchor">159</a></sup>
                  Though dominated by terracottas from the Louvre’s collection,
                  the exhibition gathered figurines from various European
                  museums, which were shown together with a number of
                  nineteenth-century works cast in their image. Another version
                  of that exhibition,
                  <em>Tanagras: Figurines for Life and Eternity,</em> was staged
                  in Valencia, Spain, in 2010.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn160" id="page-1-fnref160" class="footnote-ref-anchor">160</a></sup>
                  Dispensing with the nineteenth-century context, it focused
                  entirely on the Louvre Tanagras, and its outstanding
                  catalogue, published in Spanish and English, offers new
                  art-historical scholarship and technical research, providing a
                  fresh foundation for the further study of Tanagra figurines.

                  Whistler’s lithographs, after a period of acclaim in the
                  1890s, had also fallen out of public favor in the twentieth
                  century. For all the artist’s efforts to the contrary,
                  lithography remained closely associated with industrial
                  printing and poster art, and the particular delicacy of
                  Whistler’s lithographs made them difficult to reproduce to
                  good advantage. Moreover, in comparison with his etchings,
                  which had always been held in high esteem, and his paintings,
                  which included one of the icons of American art, Whistler’s
                  lithographs seemed insubstantial and insignificant. In 1998,
                  however, an exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago revived
                  popular and scholarly enthusiasm for this aspect of Whistler’s
                  production.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn161" id="page-1-fnref161" class="footnote-ref-anchor">161</a></sup>
                  <em>Songs on Stone: James McNeill Whistler and the Art of
                    Lithography</em>
                  not only brought the prints out of storage but celebrated the
                  publication of a catalogue raisonné,
                  <em>The Lithographs of James McNeill Whistler,</em> the
                  product of a decade’s research by a gifted team of
                  scholars.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-1-fn162" id="page-1-fnref162" class="footnote-ref-anchor">162</a></sup>
                  The comprehensive exhibition and magisterial catalogue
                  together reinstated the significance, and demonstrated the
                  unutterable charm, of this genre of Whistler’s art.

                  Emanating from Paris and Chicago, those projects are models of
                  art-historical and technical research. They recontextualize
                  the art of Hellenistic terracottas and Whistler lithographs
                  for the twenty-first century, taking their nineteenth-century
                  “discovery” into account. <em>Recasting Antiquity</em> could
                  not have been organized without them, and our work draws from
                  their scholarship to configure a new, and appropriately
                  miniaturized, interpretation of Whistler’s art and Tanagra
                  terracottas. Comprising some fifty objects, the exhibition
                  juxtaposes modern works on paper with the ancient figurines
                  that inspired them, allowing us to better understand how
                  artists conduct conversations with the past, and how the
                  notion of Tanagras as models of ideal femininity was recast
                  from antiquity to suit the desires of the modern day.

                  For James McNeill Whistler and his nineteenth-century peers,
                  the word <em>Tanagra</em> conjured the image of a small
                  terracotta figurine from Hellenistic Greece, typically
                  depicting an elegantly draped woman, naturalistically modeled
                  and enlivened with paint, perhaps veiled or wearing a
                  wide-brimmed hat, and holding a fan or a floral garland. As
                  Linda Merrill and Beth Cohen explore in their contributions to
                  this catalogue, the word, and the ancient objects it evoked,
                  not only revolutionized the nineteenth-century perception of
                  Greek art, now recast as something modern, vibrant, and
                  accessible in both demeanor and scale, in sharp contrast to
                  the monumental public marbles that defined the prevailing
                  image of classical art at the time, but it also quickly came
                  to embody a certain aesthetic mood or style that gave
                  classicizing form to the contemporary female body and to
                  contemporary notions of ideal femininity. In this sense, the
                  nineteenth-century reception of Tanagra figurines and the
                  diffuse deployment of their image in art and fashion was not
                  so far removed from their ancient function as models and
                  modelers of ideal Greek womanhood.

                <p>
                  The figurines themselves were produced across the Hellenistic
                  world but take their modern name from the site of Tanagra in
                  Boeotia in northern Greece, a leading center of production in
                  antiquity. Significant numbers were first discovered in the
                  1870s, buried inside tombs.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn1" id="page-2-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  Although representations of men, children, the elderly, and
                  gods are also known (see e.g., cat. nos.
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-6">6</a> and
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-10">10</a>), most extant Tanagras depict
                  adult, mortal women, identifiable as such by their costumes,
                  accessories, and poses.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn2" id="page-2-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  Decorated with precious pigments, and in some instances also
                  with gold, they give tantalizing insight into both the
                  original appearance of large-scale painted sculpture and the
                  dressed bodies of real women in antiquity (fig. 2.1). Indeed,
                  as Linda Merrill demonstrates, it was the extensive survival
                  of Tanagras’ polychrome decoration, as well as their intimate,
                  seemingly feminine character and scale, that excited
                  nineteenth-century collectors, artists, and scholars, who
                  interpreted them as bourgeois ornaments for the home and the
                  tomb, the ancient precursors of so many Victorian gewgaws.

                  Yet, the archaeological evidence suggests that Tanagra
                  figurines in fact most likely served as votives in both
                  funerary and sanctuary contexts,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn3" id="page-2-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  implying significance beyond passive decoration or fashion
                  archive. Hollow cast using two-piece molds (<a href="#page-catalogue-2">cat. no. 2</a>), they were infinitely replicable, easily mass-produced, and
                  more affordable than figurines made from metals or stone,
                  facilitating widespread distribution across potentially broad
                  social strata. Examples have been excavated in tombs alongside
                  jewelry, mirrors, and perfume vessels, indicating a feminine
                  context, and they seem to have been especially popular grave
                  gifts for children, where they perhaps embodied the adult
                  roles of wife and mother that the deceased child would now no
                  longer achieve.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn4" id="page-2-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Others have been found in sanctuaries dedicated to deities
                  connected with marriage, sex, and fertility, or else with the
                  passage from childhood to adulthood, including Aphrodite,
                  Artemis, Demeter, and Kore.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn5" id="page-2-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  At the town of Priene, Tanagras have been documented in
                  domestic contexts, again alongside objects like loom weights
                  and cooking utensils that are conventionally associated with
                  women, thus prompting scholars to question whether they were
                  made and purchased first as votives or were personal
                  possessions later repurposed.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn6" id="page-2-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sheila Dillon has argued that the ways in which many of the
                  female Tanagras are depicted—lavishly draped, veiled, and
                  accessorized—defines them as both elite and ideally beautiful,
                  and places them explicitly within the world of religious
                  rituals and public festivals, that is, “the world of women on
                  the public stage.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn7" id="page-2-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  Indeed, as Dillon observes, it can be no coincidence that
                  Tanagra figurines first emerged as a class of objects in
                  Athens at the same time as marble portrait statues of women,
                  which often share the same poses and costumes, begin to be
                  dedicated in the city as votives to celebrate women’s public
                  and religious roles as priestesses (fig. 2.2).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn8" id="page-2-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  This suggests a functional as well as formal relationship
                  between the two types of sculpture, positioning female
                  Tanagras as miniature monuments to Hellenistic women’s
                  participation in, and contribution to, the ritual life of the
                  city, the family, and the home.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn9" id="page-2-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>

                  This in turn opens the way for the Tanagra figurine to
                  function as the epitome of femininity, defining women’s ideal
                  public roles and social identities by offering a model of
                  appearance and behavior. Certainly, if we consider girls to be
                  one primary audience, as the funerary evidence would suggest,
                  then these Tanagras become terracotta Barbies, presenting an
                  aspirational female physique, costume, demeanor, and role for
                  their young viewers to grow into.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn10" id="page-2-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                  Taking this as its starting point, this essay nuances our
                  understanding of how Tanagra figurines defined and diffused an
                  image and idea of Greek womanhood by drawing attention to the
                  materiality of the statuettes alongside their iconography,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn11" id="page-2-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                  and by considering the significance of pigment and of clay,
                  and of the processes of molding, casting, and painting, as
                  metaphors for the construction and conceptualization of the
                  female body and of female identity in the Greek world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This returns agency to terracotta as a medium and to molding
                  as a technique, both easily dismissed as nothing more than
                  cheap alternatives to other materials and processes.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn12" id="page-2-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                  But by placing the Tanagras in conversation with an ancient
                  literary discourse that defined women as manufactured objects,
                  both hollow container painted surface, a materialist approach
                  such as this also creates space for the exploration of female
                  subjectivity and the potential for self-fashioning through the
                  same processes of adornment, draping, shaping, and molding
                  that characterized both Tanagra production and dominant
                  patriarchal views of female identity in the Greek world.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn13" id="page-2-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                </p>
                <h2>Shaping the body</h2>
                <p>
                  As has been widely discussed by Dillon and others, in terms of
                  their costume, pose, and activities, the female Tanagras
                  embody a socially determined ideal of mortal femininity, in
                  contrast to divine, that is defined by the competing
                  expectations of modesty, beauty, restraint, and sexual
                  allure.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn14" id="page-2-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                  In the Greek world, it was considered a woman’s duty to be
                  desirable to attract a husband and bear children. A wife was
                  consequently required to maintain standards of beauty,
                  cultivation, and refinement.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn15" id="page-2-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                  Sartorial elegance was also a marker of privileged status.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn16" id="page-2-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  Yet, male anxiety around women’s unchecked sexuality as a
                  threat to male honor meant that modesty in dress and behavior
                  was simultaneously promoted as a virtue; women’s adornment was
                  always viewed as potentially treacherous. For this reason,
                  laws restricted the color, transparency, and cost of garments
                  that women could wear during religious rituals, while
                  treatises warned women against wearing gold, jewels, and
                  imported silk to protect their reputations.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn17" id="page-2-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  It should not surprise us, therefore, that in modeling an
                  image of the ideal Greek woman, Tanagra figurines play with
                  contrasting ideas of visibility and invisibility, and of
                  propriety and ostentation, making the contradictory demands
                  that society placed on women integral to the form and fabric
                  of her body. This is most apparent in terms of costume and
                  pose. Most female Tanagras are conventionally dressed
                  according to contemporary fashion. A long, belted tunic
                  (<em>chiton</em>) covers most of the feet beneath a
                  lightweight mantle (<em>himation</em>) that is wrapped around
                  the body and held in place with the arms, often covering the
                  hands (<a href="#page-catalogue-4">cat. no. 4</a> is
                  representative).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn18" id="page-2-fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>
                  Many pull their mantle over their hair (e.g.,
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-3">cat. no. 3</a>), and some wear a
                  face veil (<em>tegidion</em>) (e.g.,
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-8">cat. no. 8</a>, here folded over the
                  crown of the head like a kerchief);<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn19" id="page-2-fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                  if heads appear uncovered, hair is always carefully coiffed
                  and controlled.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn20" id="page-2-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                  Arms are often crossed over the torso or raised to the chin in
                  a conventional gesture that signals modest restraint.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a result, these women appear swaddled beneath their
                  voluminous drapery, their bodies concealed and constricted in
                  a way that was deemed appropriate for public appearances,
                  especially at religious festivals,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn21" id="page-2-fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  but that simultaneously embodied the desired feminine ideals
                  of modesty, propriety, and submissiveness that endowed the
                  respectable wife with ideal beauty.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn22" id="page-2-fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                  And yet, at the same time as it obscured the body, the volume
                  of fabric worn by Hellenistic women, finely pleated,
                  meticulously layered and draped, and brightly colored with
                  expensive dyes, attracted the eye, distinguished the wearer
                  from others, and signaled her wealth and prestige. So, too,
                  did the sophisticated comportment required to control and move
                  elegantly within it.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn23" id="page-2-fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  The care with which the makers of these figurines delineated
                  the textures of different textiles, evoking the transparency
                  of fine Coan silk or Egyptian linen, colored with paint made
                  from the same costly pigments that dyed the fabrics themselves
                  (<a href="#page-catalogue-6">cat. no. 6</a>), suggests that the
                  ways in which dress made the wearer visible and desirable was
                  of equal importance to the expression of elite female identity
                  as was the performance of modesty.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn24" id="page-2-fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even the poses work to bring the body beneath the fabric to
                  the fore. One representative terracotta found at Tanagra
                  itself, now in the Louvre (<a href="#page-catalogue-3">cat. no. 3</a>), is shown with lowered gaze, clutching her mantle tightly
                  over her head and across her torso with her right arm, which
                  is raised beneath the cloak to her chest. She grips her skirt
                  and the loose folds of the mantle with her left hand, held at
                  her waist in a way that nevertheless accentuates the tilt of
                  her hips and the curve of her right thigh. Another terracotta
                  from ancient Myrina in Asia Minor, now also in the Louvre,
                  even lifts her skirts and extends her body into a sensuous

                  side (<a href="#page-catalogue-9">cat. no. 9</a>). As Sarah
                  Blundell notes, in almost every instance in which a woman is
                  shown clutching at her clothes on Athenian vases, the gesture
                  “carried intimations of eroticism.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn25" id="page-2-fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                  The same is true here: even as they seemingly attempt to
                  shield themselves from the gaze of onlookers, these figurines
                  pull their drapery tight across hips, breasts, bellies, and
                  thighs, effectively sculpting the body in a way that
                  emphasizes its physical desirability. Indeed, their poses
                  mimic the hipshot coquetry of the Aphrodite of Knidos, the
                  famous cult statue of the goddess created by the Greek
                  sculptor Praxiteles in the fourth century BCE, whose
                  disingenuous attempts to shield her nudity with her arms
                  instead directed her viewer’s desirous gaze precisely towards
                  what was not meant to be seen (fig. 2.3; also

                  By evoking the Knidia, the Tanagras’ body language hints at
                  the fertility and sexual allure of the respectable wife, and
                  of the pleasures of removing the drapery that signified her
                  virtuous reserve.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn27" id="page-2-fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                  At the same time, they remind their female viewer that only
                  adornment offers mortal women Aphrodite’s charm.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn28" id="page-2-fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>
                  But in the case of the Tanagras, of course, there is no body
                  beneath the cloth; they are completely hollow, thanks to the
                  process by which they were made.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn29" id="page-2-fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>
                  These figures are their drapery, making tangible the
                  prevailing Greek notion that the mortal female body was a
                  clothed body, or rather, that the dressed and adorned body was
                  woman’s natural state.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn30" id="page-2-fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>
                  Pandora, the first woman of Greek myth, provides the paradigm.

                  <p>
                    Forthwith [Hephaistos] the famous Lame God molded clay in
                    the likeness of a modest maid, as the son of Kronos
                    purposed. And the goddess bright-eyed Athene girded and
                    clothed her, and the divine Kharites and queenly Peitho put
                    necklaces of gold upon her, and the rich-haired Horai
                    crowned her head with spring flowers. And Pallas Athene
                    bedecked her form with all manners of finery. Also [Hermes]
                    the Guide, the Slayer of Argos, contrived within her lies
                    and crafty words and a deceitful nature at the will of loud
                    thundering Zeus, and the Herald of the gods put speech in
                    her. And he called this woman Pandora (All-Gifts), because
                    all they who dwelt on Olympos gave each a gift, a plague to
                    men who eat bread.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn31" id="page-2-fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  In the version told by the Greek poet Hesiod (thought to be
                  active around 700 BCE), Pandora comes into being through the
                  act of dressing, so that she is one and the same with the
                  finely worked garments and jewelry with which she is adorned
                  (fig. 2.4).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn32" id="page-2-fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup>
                  This is, in effect, to reduce Pandora and all women that come
                  after her to decorated surfaces,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn33" id="page-2-fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup>
                  which for Hesiod and so many other Greek writers was to define
                  woman as both highly crafted and deeply deceptive.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn34" id="page-2-fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>
                  Pandora’s beautifully wrought drapery and ornaments are as
                  much a marker of her inherent craftiness as are her cunning
                  words. Indeed, Greek and later Roman anti-cosmetic rhetoric
                  consistently presented women’s adornment as a deceptive art,
                  closely and negatively associated with artificiality, to the
                  extent that authors frequently likened women’s bodies to
                  luxury goods and manufactured objects, including vessels and
                  woven textiles, objectifying the female by highlighting the
                  constructedness and superficiality of her image.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn35" id="page-2-fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup>

                  Such analogies point to the potential gap between surface and
                  substance that adornment might open, at the same time as
                  suggesting woman’s interior emptiness, which, to the Greek
                  mind, made her both a vehicle for reproduction and an
                  insatiable glutton for luxury and sex.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn36" id="page-2-fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>
                  Tanagras, of course, make this metaphorical hollowness literal
                  by virtue of their being cast from two-piece molds. But they
                  also make it visible: almost all figurines have a square or
                  circular opening in the back, which was ostensibly to prevent
                  the terracotta from exploding by releasing moisture and hot
                  air during the firing process (fig. 2.5). Yet, the typical
                  size of these openings is approximately one inch in height,
                  which is much larger than is needed to vent air from inside a
                  terracotta sculpture. It has been suggested that the holes may
                  also have provided access to the interior of the figurines to
                  facilitate the process of connecting the separately cast parts
                  from the inside. In any case, one consequence of the enlarged
                  size of the openings is that they draw attention to the
                  figurine’s emptiness as well as to its facture, making both
                  intrinsic features of the idealized female body.

                  That Pandora should, like the Tanagras, also be molded from
                  clay only reinforces her status as an artwork. Clay is the
                  original stuff of creation used to make mankind in Sumerian,
                  Egyptian, and Greek mythological traditions,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn37" id="page-2-fnref37" class="footnote-ref-anchor">37</a></sup>
                  and retains its status as the archetypal artist’s medium
                  throughout Roman histories of artistic production. Indeed, for
                  the Roman historian Gaius Plinius Secundus (Pliny the Elder,
                  ca. 23/24–79 CE), the origins of all art are dependent on it.
                  We are told that the first portrait modeled in clay was made
                  by a Greek tile-maker, Butades of Sikyon (thought to be active
                  ca. 600 BCE), who created a likeness of the young man with
                  whom his daughter was in love by pressing clay onto the
                  surface of a wall on which she had traced his silhouetted
                  profile.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn38" id="page-2-fnref38" class="footnote-ref-anchor">38</a></sup>
                  This model was reportedly preserved in the Nymphaeum in
                  Corinth until the Roman general Lucius Mummius sacked the city
                  in 146 BCE, which was itself a critical moment in Rome’s own
                  telling of its history of encounter with Greek art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn39" id="page-2-fnref39" class="footnote-ref-anchor">39</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Pliny goes on to relate how Butades used this new technique to
                  make terracotta antefixes in the shape of faces to adorn the
                  pediments of temples, a tradition supposedly exported to Italy
                  in the seventh century BCE by Demaratos of Corinth, father of
                  Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, the first king of Rome.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn40" id="page-2-fnref40" class="footnote-ref-anchor">40</a></sup>
                  In Italy at this time, clay was also used to create cult
                  statues of gods, confirming its historical significance as a
                  key medium in the development of three-dimensional figurative
                  art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn41" id="page-2-fnref41" class="footnote-ref-anchor">41</a></sup>
                  Indeed, Pliny is careful to stress how clay also undergirds
                  the work of major Greek artists such as Lysistratos, brother
                  of the celebrated sculptor Lysippos, who was the first to
                  model sculptures in clay before casting them in bronze to
                  better capture a faithful likeness.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn42" id="page-2-fnref42" class="footnote-ref-anchor">42</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Pliny’s discussion of clay as an artist’s medium is ultimately
                  concerned with establishing the boundaries of morally viable
                  cultural production in the new Roman world of empire, which
                  threatened, with its expanded boundaries, infinite resources,
                  and ever-more capacious categories for wealth, to push
                  everything into luxuriousness.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn43" id="page-2-fnref43" class="footnote-ref-anchor">43</a></sup>
                  Where luxury represented an abuse of nature and a profligate
                  waste of resources,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn44" id="page-2-fnref44" class="footnote-ref-anchor">44</a></sup>
                  clay, by contrast, was a material that could be extracted from
                  the earth without endangering it, unlike quarrying for marbles
                  or precious metals, and that did not increase the value of the
                  objects it was used to create; likewise, its original
                  association with temple decoration and the depiction of cult
                  images ensured its moral value.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn45" id="page-2-fnref45" class="footnote-ref-anchor">45</a></sup>
                  For our purposes, though, Pliny’s discussion also helps us to
                  understand how clay as a material was inextricably bound in
                  the ancient mind to the idea of original composition, lifelike
                  representation, and the touch of the artist’s hand, and was
                  also synonymous with the development of three-dimensional
                  figurative art in history as well as in myth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To make a body from clay, then, was in many ways to promote
                  its status as handmade artwork—something rendered tangible in
                  the many terracottas that preserve the fingerprints of their
                  maker (fig. 2.6).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn46" id="page-2-fnref46" class="footnote-ref-anchor">46</a></sup>
                  But it was also to engage with a literary discourse that
                  frequently ascribed the same physical properties of clay,
                  namely its malleability and the ease with which it receives
                  impressions, to the female body. According to the philosopher
                  Aristotle (384–322 BCE), the female of any species is “softer,
                  quicker to be tamed, more receptive to handling, and readier
                  to learn” than the male,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn47" id="page-2-fnref47" class="footnote-ref-anchor">47</a></sup>
                  characteristics we might collectively categorize as being more
                  easily susceptible to outside forces, both physical and
                  mental.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn48" id="page-2-fnref48" class="footnote-ref-anchor">48</a></sup>

                  In texts by other male writers, women’s flesh is considered
                  spongier, more fluid and more permeable than men’s,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn49" id="page-2-fnref49" class="footnote-ref-anchor">49</a></sup>
                  and more in need of binding and shaping. So, the Greek
                  physician Soranos of Ephesos (b. 98 CE), writing under the
                  Roman Empire, states that all newborns need careful swaddling
                  in order to “mold every part according to its natural shape,”
                  but that girls should be bound tighter across the chest and
                  more loosely around the loins to achieve the ideal female
                  form.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn50" id="page-2-fnref50" class="footnote-ref-anchor">50</a></sup>
                  As adults, Roman women might further manipulate the shape of
                  their bodies by bolstering hips, corseting stomachs, and even
                  stitching cork into the soles of their shoes,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn51" id="page-2-fnref51" class="footnote-ref-anchor">51</a></sup>
                  suggesting how the female body remained malleable and open to
                  change, even if only—or especially—in appearance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That molding itself should be considered a female act is
                  reinforced by the language of pregnancy and reproduction found
                  in the same medical and philosophical texts. The Greek word
                  <em>matrix</em> can mean both “uterus” and “mold,” a synonymy
                  exploited in the <em>Timaeus</em> by the philosopher Plato,
                  who imagines the womb molding the fetus into shape as it
                  develops. Indeed, the potential for a womb to be like a mold
                  is even made tangible in the prevalence of mold-made
                  terracotta uteri dedicated as votives across Italy from the
                  fourth to the first century BCE (see fig. 2.7).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn52" id="page-2-fnref52" class="footnote-ref-anchor">52</a></sup>

                  Plato’s theorization of how phenomenal objects come into being
                  and change state likewise imagines a maternal space—the
                  so-called Receptacle—in which phenomena appear, disappear, and
                  receive new form.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn53" id="page-2-fnref53" class="footnote-ref-anchor">53</a></sup>
                  Verbs of molding, impressing, and modeling define Plato’s
                  concept of the Receptacle, as do gendered notions of
                  pregnancy.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn54" id="page-2-fnref54" class="footnote-ref-anchor">54</a></sup>
                  In this way, human reproduction becomes analogous to processes
                  of mechanical mark-making and serial production. But we might
                  imagine a viewer of a Tanagra figurine understanding the
                  reverse to be true, too: cast from a mold that was itself cast
                  from a hand-modeled prototype, then shaped and incised with
                  tools, these terracottas make reproduction through replication
                  and craft integral to the fabrication and function of the
                  female body,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn55" id="page-2-fnref55" class="footnote-ref-anchor">55</a></sup>
                  while at the same time embodying the common literary trope
                  that likened women to vessels and reduced them to their
                  wombs.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn56" id="page-2-fnref56" class="footnote-ref-anchor">56</a></sup>
                  Those figurines that show draped women holding swaddled
                  infants make even more explicit the conceptual link that is so
                  deeply rooted in the Greek imagination between women’s hollow
                  clay bodies and their capacity for reproduction (<a href="#page-catalogue-7">cat. no. 7</a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Indeed, a parallel metaphor common in Greek literature equated
                  women’s bodies to earth, which was considered the
                  quintessential womb,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn57" id="page-2-fnref57" class="footnote-ref-anchor">57</a></sup>
                  ready to be plowed and sown. So, we are told in the
                  <em>Timaeus</em> that the male seed is sown upon the womb “as
                  upon plowed soil,”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn58" id="page-2-fnref58" class="footnote-ref-anchor">58</a></sup>
                  while the Athenian marriage agreement, made between the
                  bride’s father and her new husband, was probably sealed with
                  the formula, “I hand over this woman to you for the plowing of
                  legitimate children.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn59" id="page-2-fnref59" class="footnote-ref-anchor">59</a></sup>
                  Not only does this reduce woman to a clay womb, a container
                  for offspring,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn60" id="page-2-fnref60" class="footnote-ref-anchor">60</a></sup>
                  at the same time as reiterating the clay-like softness and
                  permeability of her flesh, but such metaphors of husbandry
                  once again center the importance of cultivation—in the sense
                  of both taming and refining—to the production of the female
                  body and of female identity in the Greek world.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn61" id="page-2-fnref61" class="footnote-ref-anchor">61</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  This helps us to think about Pandora’s clay fabric as critical
                  to a gendered reading of her body, and hence also any female
                  body, as both artwork and womb/mold, the handmade prototype
                  from which all women are cast.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn62" id="page-2-fnref62" class="footnote-ref-anchor">62</a></sup>
                  This in turn suggests the potential for every female Tanagra
                  to be a miniature Pandora, made of earth and adorned with
                  finery. If we accept that any female viewer of a Tanagra
                  figurine saw herself reflected in its image, dressed as she
                  may have been dressed or as she aspired to be seen, then this
                  opens the way for every woman to see herself as Pandora, too.
                  Our contention in this essay is that, for a female viewer of
                  Tanagra figurines, to see herself as Pandora may in the end
                  have been empowering rather than limiting.

                  The suggestion that women required shaping and then
                  cultivating through adornment is a trope later pushed to an
                  extreme by the Roman poet Ovid (b. 43 BCE), who likens women’s
                  adorned bodies to a series of raw materials that are crude by
                  nature but made elegant by artistry.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn63" id="page-2-fnref63" class="footnote-ref-anchor">63</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Here, Ovid’s woman is not just equated to the gemstone she
                  wears but also to the sensuous depiction of Venus engraved on
                  it. The implication is that every woman needs work if she is
                  to become civilized and fulfill the role of wife and mother
                  that society demands. But by working on her appearance, she is
                  contrived—nothing more than a shimmering image carved on the
                  surface of a polished stone, concealing a dank, earthy, and
                  hollow interior.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn65" id="page-2-fnref65" class="footnote-ref-anchor">65</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ovid’s analogy also justifies the emphasis placed in this
                  essay on the potential for female viewers in antiquity to see
                  themselves reflected in the images of women that they
                  encountered—in both material and form—and for Tanagras
                  therefore to be miniature mirrors and models for the women who
                  looked at them. Even the Tanagras’ painted surfaces suggest a
                  material as well as visual correspondence between viewer and
                  figurine. Most Tanagras were covered with a ground layer of
                  white clay such as kaolinite, which created a smooth surface
                  that would bind well with applied paint, and might even be
                  burnished to add shine.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn66" id="page-2-fnref66" class="footnote-ref-anchor">66</a></sup>
                  Women’s faces were also frequently coated with a foundation
                  layer composed of different clays and chalks that aimed to
                  achieve a smooth, pale complexion, which was a much-desired
                  indicator of social status,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn67" id="page-2-fnref67" class="footnote-ref-anchor">67</a></sup>
                  and at the same time reinforces the potential for women’s
                  bodies to be clay-like in their materiality.
                </p>
                <p>
                  According to ancient written sources, the most popular
                  preparation was <em>cerussa</em>, a mixture of vinegar and
                  lead white,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn68" id="page-2-fnref68" class="footnote-ref-anchor">68</a></sup>
                  which was also a common ingredient in paints used to color the
                  faces of female Tanagras.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn69" id="page-2-fnref69" class="footnote-ref-anchor">69</a></sup>
                  White clay marl from the island of Melos, known as
                  <em>melinum</em>, was likewise used to make white paint and to
                  give a pale sheen to women’s complexions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn70" id="page-2-fnref70" class="footnote-ref-anchor">70</a></sup>
                  Analyses of white pigments used in surviving samples of Roman
                  period cosmetics reveal common use of calcite and gypsum.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn71" id="page-2-fnref71" class="footnote-ref-anchor">71</a></sup>
                  Similarly, chalk dust (<em>creta</em>) was used in antiquity
                  both to brighten the complexion and to make sealings, which
                  carried the impressions of intaglio-carved signets, like
                  Ovid’s spray-drenched Venus, suggesting how the female face
                  could be similarly shaped and impressed with a new, more
                  seductive look.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn72" id="page-2-fnref72" class="footnote-ref-anchor">72</a></sup>
                  Taken together, we might think of women sculpting their faces
                  into plaster masks before painting them with added color.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn73" id="page-2-fnref73" class="footnote-ref-anchor">73</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  As Kelly Olson notes, the literary sources indicate that rouge
                  was the next most prominent cosmetic applied to women’s faces
                  in antiquity.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn74" id="page-2-fnref74" class="footnote-ref-anchor">74</a></sup>
                  Roman authors mention red ochre (<em>rubrica</em>) and red
                  chalk as common ingredients.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn75" id="page-2-fnref75" class="footnote-ref-anchor">75</a></sup>
                  Like white lead, the former was also frequently used to create
                  the red paints used for Tanagras and other painted surfaces
                  such as wall paintings, including the billowing drapery of
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-6">cat. no. 6</a> and the lips of
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-5">cat. no. 5</a>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn76" id="page-2-fnref76" class="footnote-ref-anchor">76</a></sup>
                  Likewise, soot, ashes, and lamp black were used as kohl to
                  outline the eyes and darken the brows,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn77" id="page-2-fnref77" class="footnote-ref-anchor">77</a></sup>
                  just as carbon black was the preferred ingredient for black
                  paint.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn78" id="page-2-fnref78" class="footnote-ref-anchor">78</a></sup>
                  As mentioned previously, the materials used to color the
                  vibrant costumes of Tanagra figurines were often also used to
                  dye the real fabrics worn by Hellenistic women, including
                  cinnabar, red ochre,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn79" id="page-2-fnref79" class="footnote-ref-anchor">79</a></sup>

                  The figurine of Nike Phainomeride (Nike of the Visible Thigh)
                  excavated in a tomb in Myrina and acquired by the Louvre in
                  1883 (<a href="#page-catalogue-6">cat. no. 6</a>), wears a
                  diaphanous pink <em>peplos</em> (a robe with a distinctive
                  overfold) that has been carefully colored with a diffuse layer
                  of pink-mauve paint composed of madder mixed with lead white
                  and calcium phosphate, applied over a layer of red ochre.
                  Bands of lead white decorate the lower edge of the dress,
                  delineated by thin lines of yellow ochre.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn82" id="page-2-fnref82" class="footnote-ref-anchor">82</a></sup>
                  The effect here is not only to recreate the iridescent sheen
                  of fine layered silks, as worn by real women, but also to
                  suggest movement, enhanced by the luminosity of the pigments
                  and the play of light on their surface. On some Tanagras, such
                  as the so-called Lady in Blue (fig. 2.1),<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn83" id="page-2-fnref83" class="footnote-ref-anchor">83</a></sup>
                  the application of gilding to the borders of draped mantles
                  likewise replicates the use of gold thread in the
                  embellishment of real textiles.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn84" id="page-2-fnref84" class="footnote-ref-anchor">84</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even the binders that were mixed with the pigments to make
                  paint, as well as the varnishes used to protect and embellish
                  the finished surfaces of the Tanagras, find parallels in
                  ancient cosmetics. Both are rare to survive but were likely

                  all of which are listed as ingredients in the ointments and
                  face masks women wore to smooth and polish their complexions.

                <p>
                  It has long been recognized that the application of varnishes
                  to polychrome surfaces in antiquity aimed to enliven the
                  painted image by contrasting matte areas with shiny and so
                  creating opportunities for light-play and the suggestion of
                  movement.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn91" id="page-2-fnref91" class="footnote-ref-anchor">91</a></sup>
                  This was to satisfy the dominant aesthetic of
                  <em>poikilia</em>, a term used variously in Greek literature
                  to describe shimmering or dappled things and that conveys the
                  spectacle of intricately worked, polychrome, and
                  multi-textured surfaces.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn92" id="page-2-fnref92" class="footnote-ref-anchor">92</a></sup>
                  But where the application of surface polish to a Tanagra
                  figurine stimulated the senses through the play of light and
                  suggested movement, effectively breathing life into the
                  terracotta body, like another Pygmalion’s statue,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn93" id="page-2-fnref93" class="footnote-ref-anchor">93</a></sup>
                  it is clear from the written texts that to make a woman’s
                  complexion glossy was to reverse Pygmalion’s fantasy and turn
                  her into a glittering artwork, or, in Ovid’s words, a
                  shimmering image reflected in a mirror.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn94" id="page-2-fnref94" class="footnote-ref-anchor">94</a></sup>

                <h2>Molding the self</h2>
                <p>
                  Where it is easy to understand Tanagra figurines as miniature
                  facsimiles of the women who may have dedicated them in temples
                  or with whom they were buried, literature’s emphasis on the
                  “make” in “make-up” encourages us to turn the relationship on
                  its head and instead consider the female viewers of Tanagras
                  as facsimiles of the figurines. They, too, were massaged and
                  molded into ideal form, prepared, painted, and polished with
                  lotions and pigments, and finally adorned with costly textiles
                  and jewelry, posed and artfully manipulated to attract the eye
                  of the viewer and to suggest the desirability of the body
                  beneath—a body prepared for marriage and motherhood, to be
                  exchanged as a commodity between father and husband just like
                  any other artwork. As we have seen, this synonymy is
                  encouraged not just by the representation of contemporary
                  dress and the suggestion of familiar and idealized contexts of
                  behavior and action, but in the suggestive correspondence of
                  the Tanagras’ material and manufacture to cultural ideas about
                  women’s physical ontology—their earthy, malleable flesh and
                  mold-like capacity for reproduction—as well as in the common
                  ingredients of their painted decoration. We might even think
                  about the process of mechanical reproduction used to create
                  the Tanagras, by which multiple identical figurines could be
                  cast from the same two-piece mold (fig. 2.8), dressed in
                  uniform and with anonymous faces, as analogous to the cultural
                  production of a homogenized and collective female identity
                  that occluded individual character in favor of ideal social
                  roles (namely mother, daughter, wife, priestess), and that was
                  both achieved and understood through adornment.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn95" id="page-2-fnref95" class="footnote-ref-anchor">95</a></sup>

                  If adornment, then, was the process by which women made
                  themselves into artworks to be consumed by male viewers, then
                  the Tanagras should be understood as promoting adornment’s
                  capacity to objectify the wearer. The figurines typically
                  stand on a low rectangular base (<a href="#page-catalogue-4">cat. no. 4</a>), ostensibly to stabilize the hollow form, but also to
                  underscore the terracotta’s status not as a representation of
                  a real woman but as an objet d’art, or better, as a
                  representation of a woman turned into an artwork—like
                  Pygmalion’s lover or another Pandora. This potentially
                  positions the female viewers of Tanagra figurines as both
                  willing participants in and products of a male-imposed system
                  of cosmetic control that sought to satisfy male desire and
                  diminish women’s agency by indicating their inherent
                  falseness.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn96" id="page-2-fnref96" class="footnote-ref-anchor">96</a></sup>
                  Sarah Blundell has posited in her discussion of scenes of
                  female adornment on Athenian vessels, which were typically
                  used by women as containers for make-up, perfume, or jewelry,
                  that female viewers had learned to be pleased by images of
                  themselves that were pleasing to men and that reproduced
                  dominant patriarchal views of women’s roles,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn97" id="page-2-fnref97" class="footnote-ref-anchor">97</a></sup>
                  and subsequently sought to model their bodies in their
                  likeness. If Tanagras were designed according to male ideals
                  about women’s appearances, and were in turn produced by male
                  artisans,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn98" id="page-2-fnref98" class="footnote-ref-anchor">98</a></sup>
                  then this also opens the door for them to appeal to male
                  viewers as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Recent scholarship, however, has argued for a more positive
                  view of adornment, seeing it less as a process of
                  objectification and more as a means of positive
                  self-construction. Olson has promoted a view of women’s
                  adornment as “a deliberate act, indicative of both female
                  agency and a knowledge of the power of the visual, by which a
                  woman could communicate the self to others and infuse the self
                  with a sense of esteem and legitimacy.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn99" id="page-2-fnref99" class="footnote-ref-anchor">99</a></sup>
                  She suggests that we need to view women as knowledgeable
                  social actors who used adornment as a “creative way by which
                  to exercise a means of authority and influence, a means to
                  become sexually and economically visible and attract
                  attention.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn100" id="page-2-fnref100" class="footnote-ref-anchor">100</a></sup>
                  For Leslie Shumka, the capacity to design and maintain a look
                  through makeup, jewelry, and dress was one of the few ways in
                  which Roman women could express themselves, and constituted a
                  different kind of craft, a means of shaping one’s own
                  identity.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn101" id="page-2-fnref101" class="footnote-ref-anchor">101</a></sup>
                  She notes the prevalence of representations of toiletry
                  articles on Roman women’s tombstones as evidence for the ways
                  in which women’s personal ornamentation was viewed positively
                  by women as a vehicle of self-expression.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn102" id="page-2-fnref102" class="footnote-ref-anchor">102</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  This encourages us to look at the Tanagras as comparable
                  embodiments of Hellenistic women’s capacity to manipulate
                  their own image and through it their identity. Like the
                  tombstones that Shumka discusses, the presence of so many
                  Tanagras in what were likely female graves implies a positive
                  association between these idealized images of femininity and
                  the women who viewed them. Certainly, the evocation of women’s
                  public presence and religious roles, as suggested by the
                  Tanagras’ dress, opens space for female celebration of women’s
                  social visibility and their participation in the civic life of
                  the community. We have also seen how women’s manipulation of
                  their drapery and their body language could be a means of
                  commanding attention, arousing desire, and communicating
                  wealth on a public stage.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn103" id="page-2-fnref103" class="footnote-ref-anchor">103</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  But where we might view this as evidence of women’s acceptance
                  of the narrow remit of their public visibility, which was
                  limited by function and controlled by dress, Nancy Sorkin
                  Rabinowitz, in her discussion of Athenian vases, has pointed
                  to the ways in which images of women that promoted an ideal
                  look or behavior contributed to women’s sense of themselves as
                  a community and subsequently to the establishment of a female
                  culture that prioritized female viewers (and hence also female
                  makers) of female bodies, to the exclusion of the male.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn104" id="page-2-fnref104" class="footnote-ref-anchor">104</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tanagras embody this potential for a self-supporting and
                  self-regarding community of women cast in each other’s
                  image.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn105" id="page-2-fnref105" class="footnote-ref-anchor">105</a></sup>
                  Unlike the life-size marble statues of women with which they
                  were clearly in conversation, displayed publicly and seen by
                  both men and women, the contexts within which the terracottas
                  were viewed implies a more intimate and perhaps exclusively
                  female audience. It is unlikely that men would have frequented
                  the sanctuary spaces in which the female Tanagras were
                  dedicated, while the figures’ small-scale restricted how many
                  people could look closely at any one time, facilitating
                  women’s private contemplation of the female form and inviting
                  personal communion between image and viewer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If we accept the gendered associations of molding as a
                  technique, then we might also view Tanagras as female-made, at
                  least conceptually. This is further encouraged when we
                  consider that molds were sometimes cast directly from other
                  terracotta figurines, establishing family-trees of mother,
                  daughter, and sister casts, which evokes Hesiod’s description
                  of Pandora propagating the race of women, seemingly
                  independently of men.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn106" id="page-2-fnref106" class="footnote-ref-anchor">106</a></sup>
                  But the depiction of a female potter on the so-called
                  <a href="#page-https-www-carc-ox-ac-uk-record-93ed3845-45ed-4b57-928b-e06cbc89b738" target="_blank">Caputi Hydria</a>, an Athenian red-figure hydria attributed to the Leningrad
                  Painter, now in the Torno collection in Milan,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn107" id="page-2-fnref107" class="footnote-ref-anchor">107</a></sup>
                  provides tantalizing evidence for the real existence of female
                  artisans working with clay. This encourages us to consider the
                  possibility that at least some Tanagras were made by female
                  coroplasts, and making Gerome’s fantasy of a female-run
                  Tanagra workshop less fanciful than it might seem (see fig
                  1.5).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn108" id="page-2-fnref108" class="footnote-ref-anchor">108</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although we may in truth never know the gender of the artisans
                  that made Tanagras in antiquity, reframing these figurines as
                  female-made, female-viewed, and self-generated gives new
                  agency to their clay medium and to the perceived clay-like
                  bodies of real women. Rather than the passive product of an
                  artist’s hand, they become autochthonous, “born from the
                  earth,” like Erichthonios, the mythical first king of Athens,
                  and so are intrinsically capable of endlessly recasting
                  themselves and their appearances. We have already hinted at
                  how the poses that the Tanagras strike and the ways that they
                  manipulate their dress enacts a kind of body modulation, so
                  that they sculpt their form by pulling, gathering, and draping
                  their garments into new shapes that echo the erotic curves of
                  the Knidia. That this is so often done with hands and arms
                  that are enclosed within the folds of the fabric that they
                  handle (e.g., cat. nos. <a href="#page-catalogue-3">3</a>,
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-3">4</a>,
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-3">5</a>) reiterates that this is an
                  interior, autonomous action, a moment of self-craft that
                  encourages the Tanagras’ female viewers to feel empowered by
                  the opportunities that adornment presented to engage in
                  self-production.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn109" id="page-2-fnref109" class="footnote-ref-anchor">109</a></sup>
                  If we take Sarah Blundell’s lead and recognize the erotic
                  frisson of images of women shown clutching their clothes,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn110" id="page-2-fnref110" class="footnote-ref-anchor">110</a></sup>
                  then we might go one step further and even see the Tanagras as
                  embodiments of the pleasures of self-expression through
                  adornment, which becomes a form of self-love once we
                  prioritize women as both the makers and the viewers of the
                  adorned female body.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Certainly, without a male audience, posing like Aphrodite
                  becomes a way of declaring one’s desirability to oneself,
                  recalibrating the misogynistic view of adornment as a means of
                  cultivating the wayward female body instead into a model of
                  self-care. And it is worth noting here that many of the same
                  ingredients that were used for women’s cosmetics and for the
                  decoration of Tanagra figurines were also used as therapeutic
                  medicines in antiquity.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn111" id="page-2-fnref111" class="footnote-ref-anchor">111</a></sup>
                  Even clay was a popular remedy for various conditions. For
                  example, Pliny notes that red clay from Lemnos was used as a
                  red pigment but could also be applied as a liniment or
                  ingested to counteract snake bites and other poisons, treat
                  sore eyes, and even to control menstruation.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn112" id="page-2-fnref112" class="footnote-ref-anchor">112</a></sup>
                  The clay was reportedly sold in sealed packages, formed into a
                  tablet known as a <em>sphragis</em>, or “seal,” and impressed
                  with a signet bearing the image of the goddess Artemis,
                  underscoring a material and functional relationship between
                  medicine, cosmetics, pigments, and objects of adornment,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn113" id="page-2-fnref113" class="footnote-ref-anchor">113</a></sup>
                  and implying an intimate connection to the female body.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Indeed, as Amy Richlin notes, the properties of cosmetics,
                  medicines, poisons, and even magic were frequently conflated
                  in antiquity as comparable crafts that aimed at “a certain
                  kind of control over the body and its surroundings.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn114" id="page-2-fnref114" class="footnote-ref-anchor">114</a></sup>
                  Unsurprisingly, for most male commentators, this reiterated
                  the danger of the cosmetically enhanced woman, whose
                  constructed appearance was not only untrustworthy but also
                  potentially harmful. But from a female perspective, we might
                  instead see the therapeutic possibilities of cosmetics as a
                  means of soothing and bolstering the self, either physically
                  or psychologically. With the medicinal uses of clay in mind,
                  Tanagras’ draped and painted terracotta bodies go one step
                  further and promote adornment as a means of protecting and
                  healing the body, giving it a shinier, more powerful, and more
                  vital appearance.
                </p>
                <h2>Unmaking the self</h2>
                <p>
                  Tanagra figurines, then, not only offered an image of ideal
                  femininity to their female viewers, but also a model for its
                  construction that was contingent on the material possibilities
                  of clay and paint as substances intimately connected to the
                  female body in the Greek imagination, and of molding as a
                  method that was evocative of pregnancy and reproduction. If
                  the female body was a dressed body, then Tanagras suggest
                  possibilities for draping and adorning with jewelry and
                  cosmetics to be a means of constructing and even caring for
                  the self in a way that was empowering both in private and in
                  public.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Produced in multiples and perhaps viewed serially, they also
                  established a female look that enabled women to find pleasure
                  in their capacity to satisfy the male gaze, but more
                  importantly, also to find pleasure in their capacity to shape
                  a self that was visible, desirable, self-generated,
                  self-sustaining, and able to define women’s sense of
                  themselves as a community. They also invite an embodied form
                  of viewing. By endlessly repeating the same gestures of
                  clutching, grasping, and manipulating their drapery, Tanagras
                  encourage their viewers to imagine the feel of different
                  fabrics and the sensation of moving within billowing skirts,
                  in a way that reiterates the pleasures of adornment, both
                  material and experiential.

                <p>
                  But some Tanagras offer a riposte to this model of female
                  self-production through dress and demeanor. The so-called
                  <em>Titeux Dancer</em>, perhaps the most iconic Tanagra of the
                  nineteenth century,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn115" id="page-2-fnref115" class="footnote-ref-anchor">115</a></sup>
                  discovered in Athens in 1846 and widely referenced by numerous
                  artists of the period, exemplifies a popular class of
                  terracottas depicting veiled dancers that were found across
                  the Mediterranean from the early fourth century BCE (<a href="#page-catalogue-1">cat. no. 1</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn116" id="page-2-fnref116" class="footnote-ref-anchor">116</a></sup>
                  She is shown mid-pirouette, with her thin drapery falling
                  loosely away from her body in tumbling waves that swirl around
                  her ankles; her garment is so delicate and her movement so
                  rapid that it washes over breasts, stomach, and legs like
                  water, so that she appears almost naked despite being fully
                  draped. In fact, she looks more like representations of
                  maenads, the mythical female followers of Dionysos, god of
                  ecstasy, abandon, and altered states, who symbolized women’s
                  wild, unfettered nature, and were typically shown in various
                  states of undress (fig. 2.9).

                  Unlike her demure terracotta sisters, therefore, this Tanagra
                  offers an alternative to the strict control of dress and
                  deportment that conventionally defined women’s social
                  standing. Hers is a body instead striving to free itself from
                  its drapery, and in so doing, redefines adornment as a
                  potentially de-civilizing force. It has been argued that these
                  veiled dancers depict female worshippers engaged in specific
                  ritual practice, which may, indeed, have been associated with
                  Dionysos and other ecstatic deities. They may also be
                  professional dancers, perhaps performing the
                  <em>baukismos</em>, a spinning dance of Ionian origin that is
                  defined in the ancient sources by its grace, intricacy, and
                  sensuality. According to Julius Pollux, a Greek writer of the
                  second century CE, the <em>baukismos</em> was “a dainty type
                  of dance that liquefies the body,”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn117" id="page-2-fnref117" class="footnote-ref-anchor">117</a></sup>
                  while the cultic dances associated with Dionysos and others
                  offered similar possibilities for the dissolution of physical
                  and metaphysical boundaries and for release from all
                  constraint. This hints at how the fluid dress worn by the
                  <em>Titeux Dancer</em> and other terracotta dancers might
                  instead promote the potential for adornment to take the wearer
                  beyond even the limits of self-production: to be a means not
                  only of shaping oneself into ideal form, but of liberating the
                  self entirely from society’s strictures and becoming
                  formless.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-2-fn118" id="page-2-fnref118" class="footnote-ref-anchor">118</a></sup>
                  Defined by their ever-malleable materiality, in this way
                  Tanagra figurines come to symbolize models of both manufacture
                  and emancipation for the Greek female body and its female
                  viewers.

                        Production of so-called Tanagra style figurines is
                        generally considered to have lasted from 330 to 200 BCE,
                        with Tanagra and Thebes as major centers of manufacture.
                        The style originated, however, in Athens in the third
                        quarter of the fourth century BCE; see Jeammet 2010,
                        62–69. The literature on Tanagra figurines is lengthy.

                        popular grave gifts. Just like Barbie, these dolls

                        Much scholarship on Tanagras has been concerned with
                        typology and iconography, that is, on pose, drapery
                        style, and attributes, useful for determining questions
                        of production, chronology, and social significance.
                        Little attention has been given to the materiality of
                        Tanagra figurines, beyond scientific analyses of their’
                        clay fabric and surface decoration, often for the
                        purposes of determining production techniques and
                        workshop locations. See for example, Brigitte Bourgeois,
                        “Arts and crafts of colour on the Louvre’s Tanagra
                        Figurines,” in Jeammet, <em>Tanagras</em> (2010),
                        238–244.

                        Indeed, the perceived ordinariness of terracotta was
                        part of what appealed to the Victorian viewers of

                        Llewellyn-Jones suggests female veiling was commonplace

                        According to Pseudo-Lucian (<em>Amores</em> 17), the
                        Knidia was so attractive that young men even attempted

                        As Dillon observes, concealing the body beneath layers
                        of sumptuous fabric, constantly manipulated to hint at
                        the physical form beneath, was also a stratagem deployed
                        by prostitutes in ancient Greece. This underscores the
                        potential ambiguity of female adornment and increased
                        female visibility, which made women’s bodies hard to

                        The Greek word for ‘receptacle,’ <em>hupodoche</em>,
                        derives from the verb <em>hupodechomai</em>, which can
                        mean ‘to host/entertain’ or, of a woman, ‘to
                        conceive/become pregnant’; Emmanuela Bianchi,

                        <em>Timaeus</em> 50c-e, the Receptacle is described as
                        an <em>ekmageion</em>, a word that denotes impress,

                    Professional models are a purely modern invention. To the
                    Greeks, for instance, they were quite unknown.

                  <p>—Oscar Wilde, “London Models,” 1899</p>

                <p>
                  The models who arrived at Whistler’s studio around 1890 were
                  invited to remove their hats, coats, corsets, and boots, and
                  leave their cares and inhibitions at the door. Once inside,
                  they might don some diaphanous drapery, perhaps with a
                  kerchief to hold back their hair, or they might wear nothing
                  at all. The furnishings were sparse in the cavernous space,
                  but there was a stove for warmth, a sofa for naps, and other
                  small comforts to help the models feel at home. We know from
                  one eyewitness that Whistler did not expect them to strike a
                  pose; they were free to wander about the studio—lounging,
                  dancing, reading—until some unconscious movement or attitude
                  caught the artist’s eye and “seemed to him a picture.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn1" id="page-3-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  The resulting “figures” (as images of nude and draped models
                  are known) were often rendered in the form of lithographs,
                  prints that capture and multiply the lightest touch of the
                  artist’s hand.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although Whistler referred to these easygoing studio pictures
                  simply as “draped &amp; nude figures,”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn2" id="page-3-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  scholars and collectors often call them “Tanagras,” a title of
                  convenience we are happy to adopt.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn3" id="page-3-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  The term is properly applied to the ancient terracotta
                  figurines unearthed during the final decades of the nineteenth
                  century around the ancient city of Tanagra, in the Boeotian
                  region of Greece, but it evokes the delicate grace that
                  distinguishes this category of Whistler’s imagery. His
                  so-called Tanagras do not depict Tanagra figurines, in which
                  the body is typically enveloped in drapery, but they represent
                  a similarly informal interpretation of a statelier classical
                  style.

                  If Whistler never explicitly related his assertively modern
                  works to the ancient terracottas, he tacitly acknowledged the
                  aesthetic affinities that were obvious to his contemporaries.
                  Perhaps the first to make the connection was Oscar Wilde, who
                  in 1882 associated Whistler’s art with Tanagra figurines, each
                  “as delicate in perfect workmanship and as simple in natural
                  motive” as the other.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn4" id="page-3-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  Elizabeth Robins Pennell, in an 1897 article for
                  <em>Scribner’s Magazine</em> written in close consultation
                  with the artist, observed that “these studies have been
                  likened, more than once, to the work of Tanagra; and justly,
                  for theirs is the same flawless daintiness, the same purity of
                  pose, the same harmony of line, the same grace of
                  contour.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn5" id="page-3-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>

                <p>
                  James Abbott (later McNeill) Whistler was born in
                  Massachusetts, but his life as an artist began in Paris.
                  Arriving at age twenty-one, he was already fluent in French
                  from a childhood spent in imperial Saint Petersburg, and he
                  was conversant with the culture of the Latin Quarter from
                  repeated readings of Henri Murger’s
                  <em>Scenes of Bohemian Life.</em> Nominally an art student,
                  Whistler never submitted to the traditional academic training
                  that would have compelled him to draw from plaster casts of
                  classical sculptures before proceeding, at length, to drawing
                  from life (the nude model), and it was not until years later,
                  when he was already established as an artist in London, that
                  he came to appreciate the cost of his neglect. In 1867, a
                  well-respected art critic condemned Whistler’s figures as
                  poorly drawn, “an impertinence of which the artist ought to be
                  as much ashamed as we hope he would be if found in a
                  drawing-room with a dirty face.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn6" id="page-3-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                  He was indeed chagrined. “What a frightful education I gave
                  myself,” Whistler lamented to Henri Fantin-Latour, his best
                  friend in Paris, “or rather what a terrible lack of education
                  I feel I have had!” Under the “odious” influence of Gustave
                  Courbet, he had allowed the attractions of Realism to lure him
                  from the studio. Now, at age thirty-three, he would have to
                  start over from the very beginning. “I’m sure I will make up
                  for the time I’ve wasted—but what difficulties,” he wrote. “I
                  spend the whole day drawing from models!!”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn7" id="page-3-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  With his new friend Albert Joseph Moore (1841–1893), an
                  English artist equally lacking in formal training, Whistler
                  practiced making “academy studies” from the nude figure. Until
                  then, his artworks had depicted scenes from modern life, while
                  Moore’s had tended toward antiquity, visions of beauty remote
                  from the contemporary world. With his meticulous working
                  methods and high aesthetic ideals, Moore was the antithesis
                  of—and for Whistler, the antidote to—Realism and Courbet.
                  Whistler carried out his remedial project from a rented studio
                  overlooking the British Museum, which housed the architectural
                  sculpture from the Parthenon. For Whistler and his
                  contemporaries, the Elgin Marbles represented the summit of
                  artistic achievement: “the best and highest—never likely, or
                  even possible, to be excelled in any future age of the
                  world.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn8" id="page-3-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  Thus it was that Whistler attempted to formulate an original
                  approach to ideal, or abstract, beauty in the shadow of that
                  epitome of perfection.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In keeping with the seriousness of his enterprise, Whistler’s
                  “academic” drawings from the latter 1860s appear studiously
                  remote and disaffected. He was undoubtedly intimidated by his
                  project, as a passage in Pennell’s <em>Scribner’s</em> article
                  implies: “By his drawing of the nude, the measure of an
                  artist’s capacity—or incapacity—may be judged. By it he stands
                  convicted of perfection, or of failure as it may be and too
                  often is.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn9" id="page-3-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  <em>Standing Nude</em> (fig. 3.1), an overdetermined effort to
                  portray the calm repose of classical art, betrays Whistler’s
                  own discomfort with both the female nude and the academic
                  exercise. The unnamed figure (inevitably called “Venus”) is
                  vaguely reminiscent of antique statuary—like the
                  <a href="#page-https-www-uffizi-it-en-artworks-medici-venus" target="_blank">Medici Venus</a>, her right arm shields her breasts, and like the
                  <a href="#page-https-www-louvre-fr-en-explore-the-palace-ideal-greek-beauty" target="_blank">Venus de Milo</a>, her left arm is absent altogether—which suggests, as
                  Margaret MacDonald has observed, “that the themes and
                  variations of classical art were more or less absorbed in
                  Whistler’s consciousness.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn10" id="page-3-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Although shaded like a finished drawing, Whistler’s
                  <em>Standing Nude</em> was intended as a cartoon, or full-size
                  pattern for a painting, in which the figure would be clothed,
                  or as the artist informed a potential patron in 1869, “clad in
                  thin transparent drapery.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn11" id="page-3-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                  A small oil sketch made to determine the color scheme (<a href="#page-catalogue-14">cat no. 14</a>), a custom adopted from Moore, provides a key to Whistler’s
                  vision for the final work. A violet scarf tied around the
                  figure’s head swirls behind her to connect with the
                  white-dotted sash pulled across her body and gathered lightly
                  with a swathe of pink drapery in one hand; the other holds a
                  circular Japanese fan like the ones pinned arbitrarily to the
                  wall behind her. That unexpected accessory emblematizes the
                  wave of inspiration flowing from Japan, which Moore and
                  Whistler both insinuated into their classicizing art. Standing
                  beside the figure is a slender blue and white vase evocative
                  of Chinese porcelain; it holds vivid purple irises that pick
                  up the shade of the sash like the thread of an embroidery, as
                  Whistler explained his technique, “the whole forming in this
                  way an harmonious <em>pattern</em>.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn12" id="page-3-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whistler’s little oil, known for decades as <em>Tanagra</em>,
                  was long believed by many scholars (including myself) to be an
                  homage to the ancient terracottas.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn13" id="page-3-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                  We were led astray by the title, posthumously assigned to the
                  sketch because of its presumed connection with a pastel
                  drawing once exhibited by that name.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn14" id="page-3-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                  But even without its Greek misnomer, Whistler’s elegantly
                  draped figure, fan in hand, resembles a Tanagra figurine, and
                  the small scale, delicate facture, and muted colors of the
                  work lend further support to the association. It is unlikely,
                  however, that Whistler or anyone else in his circle had ever
                  laid eyes on an actual Tanagra as early as 1869, when the oil
                  sketch was made.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn15" id="page-3-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                  As the Louvre historian Néguine Mathieux has remarked, certain
                  artists were painting “Tanagras,” or “young draped women
                  depicted with an idealized grace and in pastel colours,” even
                  before the actual Tanagra figurines were unearthed in
                  Greece.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn16" id="page-3-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  That Whistler fell under the spell of the terracotta figurines
                  has never been in doubt. They offered a welcome alternative to
                  the implacable perfection of classical Greek art, adhering to
                  a more attainable standard of beauty and personifying a more
                  modern sensibility. “The calm repose of antique art is here
                  replaced by vivacity and movement,” the antiquarian Frederic
                  Vors observed in 1879: “They are the embodiment of momentary
                  action and transitory motion.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn17" id="page-3-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                  Whistler’s silence on the subject makes it impossible to know
                  exactly when, or how, he first encountered the Tanagras,
                  though hints of influence begin turning up in his works around
                  1873, just as the figurines were making their way into museum
                  collections and private hands. Katharine Lochnan has
                  identified an etching of a draped standing figure (fig. 3.2)
                  as the first of the “Tanagras,” detecting in the hairstyle a
                  hint of the distinctive “melon” coiffure and noting in the
                  drapery the arrangement of chiton and mantle that make up the
                  Tanagra costume.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn18" id="page-3-fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Beyond such visual clues, which might also point to a
                  continuing engagement with the classical, only circumstantial
                  evidence supports the speculation that as early as the 1870s,
                  Tanagras inspired Whistler’s creativity. In fact, the only
                  irrefutable physical evidence that the artist ever
                  acknowledged the aesthetic possibilities of the ancient
                  terracottas is a faint pencil sketch (fig. 3.3) of a
                  photograph of a single statuette (fig. 3.4), which could not
                  have been made before the mid 1890s. The sketch is preserved
                  in an album that was probably lent to the artist by his friend
                  Alexander A. Ionides (1840–1898), who possessed a celebrated
                  collection of Tanagras and thus became, in the words of John
                  Sandberg, the artist’s “direct path to classical
                  antiquity.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn19" id="page-3-fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>

                <h2>A Connoisseur’s Treasures</h2>
                <p>
                  Aleco, as Alexander Alexander Ionides was known to his
                  friends, met Whistler in Paris in 1855. He was there to
                  improve his French, although at sixteen he already spoke the
                  language like a native, according to George du Maurier, whose
                  1894 novel <em>Trilby</em> is based on his own reminiscences
                  of his art-student days. “The Greek,” as du Maurier calls
                  Aleco, was popular with the artists “for his
                  <em>bonhomie,</em> his niceness, his warm geniality,” and also
                  because “he was the capitalist of this select circle (and
                  nobly lavish of his capital).” When Whistler and his Parisian
                  colleagues “transferred their bohemia to London” around 1860,
                  they were warmly welcomed to the Ionides’s gracious family
                  home in Tulse Hill, on the outskirts of town.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn20" id="page-3-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The patriarch was Alexander Constantine Ionides (1810–1890),
                  who had fled Constantinople in 1827, eventually settling in
                  London with his wife, Euterpe Sgouta. Over the years, he
                  shifted the family business from the import trade to merchant
                  banking, and from 1854 to 1866 acted as consul general for
                  Greece. Within months of Aleco’s birth in 1840, his father
                  commissioned a
                  <a href="#page-https-collections-vam-ac-uk-item-o81538-the-family-of-alexander-constantine-oil-painting-watts-george-frederick" target="_blank">family portrait</a>, in which the chubby-cheeked baby poses with his elder
                  brothers Constantine (1833–1900) and Luke (1837–1924), both in
                  traditional Greek costume. The portraitist, George Frederic
                  Watts, became a close family friend, and it was he who called
                  the elder Ionides’s attention to the first work Whistler
                  exhibited at the Royal Academy,
                  <a href="#page-https-artsandculture-google-com-asset-at-the-piano-james-mcneill-whistler-ywf14p8hp3gl9q-hl-en" target="_blank"><em>At the Piano.</em></a>
                  Consequently, Ionides commissioned Whistler to paint a
                  <a href="#page-https-commons-wikimedia-org-wiki-file-brown-and-silver-old-battersea-bridge-by-james-mcneil-whistler-1859-1863-oil-on-canvas-addison-gallery-of-american-art-phillips-academy-andover-andover-massachusetts-dsc05273-jpg" target="_blank">Thames scene</a>
                  and

                  and went on to encourage his own children and others in his
                  extended family to support young artists trying to find a
                  foothold in the competitive London art world.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn22" id="page-3-fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Euterpe Ionides sold her diamonds in 1864, or so the story
                  goes, to buy No. 1 Holland Park, a newly constructed mansion
                  in a fashionable Kensington neighborhood. Whistler was a
                  frequent visitor to the house until 1867, when he was involved
                  in a dispute with his own brother-in-law, and Aleco was the
                  only member of his family to take the artist’s side.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn23" id="page-3-fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  Some years later, when Whistler’s brother William married
                  Aleco’s cousin Helen (known as Nellie), the friendship was
                  sealed with a family bond. By then, Aleco Ionides had become
                  “a swell,” as Whistler remarked in 1873, by which he meant a
                  distinguished person with a prospering career in the City.
                  Aleco was also beginning to manage the household in Holland
                  Park while his parents gradually retired to Windycroft, their
                  country home near Hastings.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn24" id="page-3-fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1875, Aleco Ionides married Isabella Sechiari, another
                  member of the Anglo-Greek community, though born in Marseille.
                  On their honeymoon in Paris, they visited the Louvre expressly
                  to see the Tanagra figurines. The museum had made its initial
                  acquisitions in 1872, assisted by the young archaeologist
                  Olivier Rayet, who had been in Athens when the figurines first
                  appeared on the market. By 1874, over sixty “specimens” went
                  on display in mahogany cases lining the walls of the Charles X
                  Gallery (fig. 3.5).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn25" id="page-3-fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                  Aleco and Isabella may have been motivated to see the
                  collection for themselves by an illustrated article published
                  in the April issue of the <em>Gazette des Beaux-Arts</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-49">cat. no. 49</a>). Written by Rayet himself, it provided an “historic and
                  descriptive account of the curious statuettes and other small
                  works of Greek art discovered at Tanagra in Boeotia.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn26" id="page-3-fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>

                  Although the Louvre collection was considerably larger, the
                  Ionides family’s collection was “as perfect,” the newlyweds
                  decided.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn27" id="page-3-fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                  From that observation we may surmise that it had effectively
                  taken shape by 1875. Marcus B. Huish, writing in 1898, begins
                  his chronicle of the Ionides collection “some five-and-twenty
                  years ago,” when “the spade awoke from their sleep of
                  centuries the assemblage of elegant and coquettish figurines
                  which had only to be seen to be appreciated.” Aleco Ionides
                  was “on the spot,” according to Huish—a statement that cannot
                  be verified and may have been contrived to confirm the
                  collection’s authenticity.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn28" id="page-3-fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>
                  Nevertheless, Aleco’s father probably retained diplomatic ties
                  from his term as consul general, and the family’s connections
                  with the Archaeological Society of Athens (though it did not
                  begin to excavate the site until 1874) may also have
                  facilitated the acquisition and export of fresh antiquities
                  from Tanagra.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn29" id="page-3-fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Over the next few years, as Aleco’s social standing rose—he
                  himself was appointed Greek consul general in 1883—his
                  holdings of Tanagra figurines continued to expand, and in
                  January 1885 the collection earned official sanction with an
                  exhibition at the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria
                  &amp; Albert).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn30" id="page-3-fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>
                  Once back at Holland Park, the figurines were installed in a
                  drawing room recently remodeled into an “antiquities room,”
                  which gave them pride of place. The artist Walter Crane
                  (1845–1915) had been commissioned to create a showcase for
                  their display (fig. 3.6), a two-tiered, pedimented structure
                  which surmounted the fireplace like an overmantel, that
                  typically Victorian construction designed to draw attention to
                  the hearth of the home by surrounding it with the owner’s
                  possessions. Crane described his construction as “a sort of
                  temple-like cabinet” made of ebony, with columns of red and
                  yellow marble, “midway in tone between the extremes of light
                  terra-cotta and dark limestone.” On the lower level, Doric
                  columns defined seven arched niches with gilded recesses for
                  individual figurines; the upper tier, in the correct Ionic
                  order, was divided into three sections to give special
                  prominence to prized terracottas.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn31" id="page-3-fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>

                  The shrine was designed to hold the collection as it stood in
                  1889, when it was photographed by Bedford Lemere, together
                  with other rooms and works of art at Holland Park. Those
                  photographs illustrate an account of the Ionides house written
                  by the designer Lewis&nbsp;F.&nbsp;Day and published in the
                  <em>Art Journal</em> in 1893 (<a href="#page-catalogue-53">cat. no. 53</a>). According to Day, who would have heard it from Aleco,
                  those original figurines were “among the first found at
                  Tanagra, before ever forgeries were thought of.” By then, the
                  trade in forgeries was openly acknowledged: the first had been
                  made around 1876, and ten years later it was estimated that
                  three times as many fake as genuine terracottas were sold each
                  year.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn32" id="page-3-fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup>
                  Nevertheless, Aleco persevered, trusting his eye and intuition
                  despite persistent reports of fraud in the antiquities market.
                  Indeed, Day mentions two recently acquired Tanagra statuettes
                  that were too new and probably too ornate to find a place in
                  the overmantel. Those mythological subjects, sure to appeal to
                  late-Victorian taste, were almost certainly forgeries (fig.
                  3.7).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn33" id="page-3-fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup>

                  In the dining room, lavishly decorated by Crane and William
                  Morris, Whistler’s self-portrait,
                  <a href="#page-https-dia-org-collection-arrangement-gray-3a-portrait-painter-64930" target="_blank"><em>Arrangement in Grey</em></a>, hung prominently beside the fireplace. Aleco had inherited
                  the painting upon his father’s death in November 1890,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn34" id="page-3-fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>
                  just after acquiring a Whistler of his own,
                  <em><a href="#page-https-asia-si-edu-explore-art-culture-collections-search-edanmdm-fsg-f1909-127a-b" target="_blank">Nocturne in Blue and Gold: Valparaiso</a>,</em>
                  a more radical example of the artist’s increasingly abstract
                  style. Because the walls at Holland Park were by then replete
                  with pictures, the Nocturne would hang at Homewood, the
                  family’s country house in Surrey, where the light, in any
                  case, was “so much better for it,” Aleco assured his
                  friend.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn35" id="page-3-fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup>
                  At least initially, Aleco proved to be among the rare few who
                  lived up to the artist’s expectations of those who owned his
                  works—or cared for them on his behalf, as Whistler understood
                  the situation. Aleco generously allowed his new acquisition to
                  be exhibited in the Grand Palais des Champs-Élysées in 1890
                  and again in London in 1892, at the Whistler retrospective
                  held at the Goupil Gallery. Indeed, on the latter occasion,
                  Aleco offered to lend every Whistler painting in his
                  possession.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn36" id="page-3-fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The reason for his magnanimity became apparent when Aleco
                  Ionides allowed <em>Nocturne in Blue and Gold</em> to be sold
                  from the walls of the Goupil exhibition. To Whistler’s dismay,
                  Aleco had become one of many old friends and acquaintances who
                  capitalized on the phenomenal rise in the artist’s reputation.
                  “How shockingly they have all behaved about my pictures,”
                  Whistler complained to his sister-in-law about her Greek
                  relations, Aleco in particular. A few months later he informed
                  her bitterly that Aleco had received £200 for “another little
                  <a href="#page-https-www-artic-edu-artworks-81572-trouville-grey-and-green-the-silver-sea" target="_blank">sea piece</a>
                  of mine,” purchased for around £20 soon after it was painted
                  in Trouville in 1865, or so the artist recollected.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn37" id="page-3-fnref37" class="footnote-ref-anchor">37</a></sup>
                  As it happened, the sale of the Whistlers portended a
                  precipitous fall in the fortunes of Aleco Ionides. In March
                  1894, he approached David Croal Thomson, Whistler’s dealer at
                  Goupil, about selling
                  <em>Brown and Silver: Old Battersea Bridge,</em> the painting
                  his father had commissioned and he had inherited when his
                  mother died in 1892. “I fear he is very hard pressed at the
                  present,” Thomson wrote to Whistler, “for he spoke of getting
                  rid of his whole house &amp; its contents.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn38" id="page-3-fnref38" class="footnote-ref-anchor">38</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whistler, affronted that Aleco had not told him personally,
                  was nonetheless aware of his old friend’s straitened
                  circumstances and agreed to help him sell his collection of
                  Tanagra figurines.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn39" id="page-3-fnref39" class="footnote-ref-anchor">39</a></sup>
                  Aleco probably enlisted Whistler’s assistance because the
                  artist owed him a favor, after his generosity as a lender.
                  Moreover, Whistler’s rising reputation in the international
                  art world meant that he would have the connections necessary
                  to effect a sale of such significance. The artist’s first
                  (perhaps only) thought was of Professor Emil Heilbut, a
                  scholar, collector, critic, and occasional art agent, who had
                  been the first person in Germany to acquire French
                  Impressionist paintings; because Heilbut was also one of
                  Whistler’s greatest admirers, he could be counted on to
                  cooperate. In April 1894, Whistler offered to send photographs
                  of the Ionides Tanagras as soon as they were ready, and in
                  July, Heilbut paid a visit in person to Holland Park, later
                  writing to Whistler that he had found the collection
                  “admirable” and would do what he could to help sell it.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn40" id="page-3-fnref40" class="footnote-ref-anchor">40</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  A German buyer was not forthcoming, however, probably because
                  of the well-founded fear of forgeries. Thomson tried, to no
                  avail, to interest the American industrialist Alfred Atmore
                  Pope in the Tanagras, arranging for him to visit Holland Park,
                  which Thomson had “represented,” Pope wrote afterward to
                  Whistler, “as the most artistically decorated house in
                  London.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn41" id="page-3-fnref41" class="footnote-ref-anchor">41</a></sup>
                  While the collection languished, the strain on Aleco began to
                  tell. In a letter Whistler wrote that June to his brother
                  William, he mentioned Aleco’s distracted state: “I never know
                  whether he is not thinking of something else.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn42" id="page-3-fnref42" class="footnote-ref-anchor">42</a></sup>
                  Finally in 1895, the “lovely company of Tanagra figures,”
                  together with the other remaining works of art at No. 1
                  Holland Park, were packed up and sent to Bond Street for
                  exhibition, and implicitly for sale, in a show discreetly
                  titled <em>A Connoisseur’s Treasures</em>. Even though the
                  connoisseur was named only as “a distinguished amateur,” his
                  identity would have been an open secret in the London art
                  world.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn43" id="page-3-fnref43" class="footnote-ref-anchor">43</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whistler was living in Paris at the time, but he heard from
                  Thomson that the Ionides show was attracting many visitors,
                  although “very little business is being done.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn44" id="page-3-fnref44" class="footnote-ref-anchor">44</a></sup>
                  The Tanagras did not attract the attention Aleco expected; he
                  had informed Marcus Huish “that of all his beautiful things
                  none have so quickly appealed to all, no matter how varied
                  their tastes, as these groups and figures.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn45" id="page-3-fnref45" class="footnote-ref-anchor">45</a></sup>
                  One work did sell, however—<em>Arrangement in Grey,</em> for
                  the considerable sum of £700, “a large price for a head,”
                  Whistler reflected, “even though it be my own.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn46" id="page-3-fnref46" class="footnote-ref-anchor">46</a></sup>
                  Yet the artist was again irrationally incensed that Ionides
                  had realized so much profit from one of his works. “Out of
                  softness of heart,” he wrote to Aleco, in what would be his
                  last letter to his old friend,
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    I let you off a while ago—and tried to help you in the sale
                    of your Tanagras.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But it is intolerable that all of you in England should
                    under my nose, in this sly way—turn these pictures of mine
                    over &amp; over again, &amp; without a word to me pocket
                    sums that properly you should offer to me on your bended
                    knees saying behold the price we are at last able to obtain
                    for these valuable works we have had the privilege of living
                    with all these years for eighteen pence!
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Whistler seems to have regarded the album of Tanagra
                  photographs, which had remained in Thomson’s hands for the
                  duration of the exhibition, as now belonging to him, perhaps
                  in compensation for what he regarded as his friend’s
                  ill-gotten gains.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn47" id="page-3-fnref47" class="footnote-ref-anchor">47</a></sup>
                  He kept it for the rest of his life, and at some point between
                  1895 and his death in 1903 sketched one of the figurines on a
                  blank album page (see fig. 3.3).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Tanagra terracottas remained unsold. Ionides had provided
                  for this eventuality in his will of 1889, stipulating that the
                  collection remain within the house at Holland Park as long as
                  it was occupied but then return to Greece, to the National
                  Archaeological Museum in Athens.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn48" id="page-3-fnref48" class="footnote-ref-anchor">48</a></sup>
                  The rest of the story is shrouded in mystery. A childhood
                  friend of Aleco’s who paid a call in 1897 found him as “kind
                  and affectionate as ever,” though “down on his luck and
                  ill.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn49" id="page-3-fnref49" class="footnote-ref-anchor">49</a></sup>
                  At the end of that year, the <em>Studio</em> published a
                  richly illustrated account of the palace of art in Holland
                  Park, “An Epoch-Making House” by Gleeson White, and six months
                  later Marcus Huish’s article devoted to the Tanagras appeared
                  in the same publication.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn50" id="page-3-fnref50" class="footnote-ref-anchor">50</a></sup>
                  Shortly after that, at the end of July 1898, Alexander A.
                  Ionides died at home, age 58, in circumstances that have never
                  been disclosed. No obituary appeared in the papers; indeed,
                  for all the family’s prominence in London, there seems to have
                  been no official notice of his passing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  His fortune had dwindled, but Aleco Ionides did not die
                  destitute. The total estate was valued at around £19,000—the
                  equivalent today of some $3.25 million—with small bequests to
                  charitable institutions in Athens, but most of the fortune was
                  left to his family.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn51" id="page-3-fnref51" class="footnote-ref-anchor">51</a></sup>
                  Isabella Ionides and the children deserted Holland Park for
                  their country home but kept the London house until 1908, when
                  it was sold to the trustees for the sixth Earl of Ilchester.
                  By then, the terracottas were long gone, though they had not
                  returned to Greece in accordance with Aleco’s wishes. “The
                  Well-known Collection of Objects of Art formed by the late
                  Alexander A. Ionides Esq. of 1 Holland Park W., including an
                  important series of Antiquities from Bœotia, Tanagra, Greece,
                  etc.,” had been dispersed at a Christie’s auction on March 14,
                  1902, with the terracottas selling as a single lot for
                  £5,250.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn52" id="page-3-fnref52" class="footnote-ref-anchor">52</a></sup>
                  Apart from a few minor examples held by the Harvard Art
                  Museums (<a href="#page-catalogue-11">cat. no. 11</a>), the
                  Ionides collection has since disappeared.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn53" id="page-3-fnref53" class="footnote-ref-anchor">53</a></sup>

                <h2>The Models of Chelsea</h2>
                <p>
                  In February 1885, just as popular appreciation for Tanagra
                  figurines was coming into full flower, Whistler delivered a
                  lecture on art titled the “Ten O’Clock” after the late-night
                  hour of its presentation. In that formal declaration of the
                  aestheticist creed, Whistler defines the artist as one “who
                  delights in the dainty, the sharp, bright gaiety of beauty.”
                  “Dainty” is not a word we often use today, except in reference
                  to something ridiculously delicate and out-of-date, but that
                  unassuming little adjective evoked, for Whistler, the highest
                  form of aesthetic beauty. Indeed, he envisioned art itself
                  (Art for Art’s Sake) as “a goddess of dainty thought—reticent
                  of habit, abjuring all obtrusiveness, purposing in no way to
                  better others.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn54" id="page-3-fnref54" class="footnote-ref-anchor">54</a></sup>
                  Rather like a Tanagra figurine, Whistler’s muse is classical
                  in her allegorical aspect but naturalistic, even human, in her
                  capricious affections—which the artist had learned, to his
                  grief, never to take for granted.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We might expect to find Tanagras somewhere in the “Ten
                  O’Clock,” if only listed among the artworks sanctioned by the
                  goddess, but they are never mentioned by name. This may have
                  been because they were so much in fashion. Whistler’s
                  discourse even criticizes the vogue for classical antiquity, a
                  flicker of hypocrisy seized upon by his sometime friend and
                  neighbor Oscar Wilde: “Has not Tite-street been thrilled with
                  the tidings that the models of Chelsea were posing to the
                  master, in peplums, for pastels?”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn55" id="page-3-fnref55" class="footnote-ref-anchor">55</a></sup>
                  Whistler was in fact making “striking drawings of very
                  graceful figures” around that time, according to one visitor
                  to his Tite Street studio, though his models never posed in
                  “peplums.” They posed in the nude, or draped in sheer fabrics
                  that revealed their natural form. As one critic noted dryly,
                  their “excessively slight drapery is the result of some half
                  dozen strokes of the crayon.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn56" id="page-3-fnref56" class="footnote-ref-anchor">56</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Those works in pastel built upon—indeed, superseded—the
                  serious studies from the life model that Whistler had made in
                  the 1860s and '70s to atone for his misspent youth. In at
                  least one case, <em>Note in Violet and Green</em> (fig. 3.8),
                  infrared photography reveals that Whistler simply added color
                  to an older drawing.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn57" id="page-3-fnref57" class="footnote-ref-anchor">57</a></sup>
                  And we can see from the reversal of the image that the pastel
                  known as
                  <em><a href="#page-https-www-artnet-com-artists-james-abbott-mcneill-whistler-the-greek-slave-girl-variations-in-violet-and-plevjfcqgghehvozt6trba2" target="_blank">The Greek Slave Girl (Variations in Violet and Rose)</a></em>
                  was made from a tracing of Whistler’s early lithograph
                  <em>Study</em> (see fig. 3.12).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn58" id="page-3-fnref58" class="footnote-ref-anchor">58</a></sup>
                  As revisions of monochrome figures, these colorful pastels may
                  have been inspired by the growing publicity surrounding
                  Tanagra figurines, which often called attention to “the finely
                  powdered remains of a suit of paint.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn59" id="page-3-fnref59" class="footnote-ref-anchor">59</a></sup>
                  The vestiges of color clinging to the clay surfaces accounted
                  for much of their popular appeal; in an age obsessed with the
                  myth of Pygmalion, even the hint of color on an antique statue
                  made it seem to come alive, or at least appear more accessible
                  than the polished white marbles in the British Museum.

                <p>
                  Upon seeing a selection of Whistler’s pastels in 1885, the
                  neoclassical sculptor William Wetmore Story thrilled the
                  artist with his exclamation, “Whistler, they are as charming
                  and complete as a Tanagra statue!”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn60" id="page-3-fnref60" class="footnote-ref-anchor">60</a></sup>
                  The analogy may have been prompted by a work such as
                  <em>A Study in Red</em> (fig. 3.9), whose French title,
                  <em>Danseuse athénienne</em> (although not Whistler’s),
                  provides a clue to a possible source of inspiration: the
                  famous terracotta figurine of a veiled dancer discovered in
                  1846 near the Athenian Acropolis and known as
                  <em>Danseuse Titeux</em>, or the <em>Titeux Dancer</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-1">cat. no. 1</a>). That terracotta prototype, a pre-Tanagra figurine, had
                  become widely known to artists and antiquarians throughout
                  Europe,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn61" id="page-3-fnref61" class="footnote-ref-anchor">61</a></sup>
                  and Whistler may have intended to recall the figure with his
                  own dancing girl, drawn in pastels on the rough brown paper

                  The <em>Pall Mall Gazette</em> described Whistler’s “pastel
                  pictures” of 1885 as “very slight in themselves, of the female
                  nude, dignified and graceful in line and charmingly
                  chaste.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn62" id="page-3-fnref62" class="footnote-ref-anchor">62</a></sup>
                  That final quality may have been intended to distinguish
                  Whistler’s works from the more lubricious, life-size Venuses
                  that had crowded the spring exhibitions. A letter to
                  <em>The Times</em> in May from “A British Matron” protested
                  “the display of nudity at the two principal galleries of
                  modern art in London,” prompting a flurry of correspondence as
                  artists and laypeople weighed in on the assumption—as one
                  artist summarized the Matron’s point of view—“that purity and
                  drapery are inseparable.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn63" id="page-3-fnref63" class="footnote-ref-anchor">63</a></sup>
                  The controversy culminated with the Royal Academician John
                  Callcott Horsley accusing his fellow artists of debasing young
                  girls by persuading them “so to ignore their natural modesty,
                  and quench their sense of true shame as to expose their
                  nakedness before men, and thus destroy all that is pure and
                  lovely in their womanhood.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn64" id="page-3-fnref64" class="footnote-ref-anchor">64</a></sup>
                  Thus the British Matron’s moral outrage was appended to a plea
                  for social reform: behind every nude picture, Horsley averred,
                  lay a woman posing naked for a pittance, scarcely better than
                  a prostitute.

                  In a <em>Punch</em> cartoon by Edward Linley Sambourne (fig.
                  3.10), the priggish Horsley becomes the artist’s model,
                  attired in bombazine to impersonate the anonymous author of
                  the letter to <em>The Times.</em> Recoiling in horror from the
                  Medici Venus, the Matron mutters, “Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Who
                  could ha’ sat for that?”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn65" id="page-3-fnref65" class="footnote-ref-anchor">65</a></sup>
                  Models posing in the nude were not a recent phenomenon,
                  Sambourne implies, and Whistler himself could hardly wait “to
                  twit Horsley about the nude &amp; his absurd onslaught on it,”
                  as his friend Alan Cole noted in his diary.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn66" id="page-3-fnref66" class="footnote-ref-anchor">66</a></sup>

                  The opportunity arose in December 1885, when Whistler’s own
                  nearly nude figures went on display at the Society of British
                  Artists. To the frame of one of them (probably
                  <em>Note in Violet and Green</em>, fig. 3.8), he affixed a
                  label imprinted, “Horsley soit qui mal y pense.” If now
                  abstruse, the quip was readily understood in its time as a
                  play on the Old Anglo-Norman motto of the chivalric Order of
                  the Garter, <em>Honi soit qui mal y pense,</em> meaning,
                  “Shame on anyone who thinks evil of it.” One journalist
                  construed Whistler’s act as “an indignant protest against the
                  idea that there is any immorality in the nude,”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn67" id="page-3-fnref67" class="footnote-ref-anchor">67</a></sup>
                  but the artist’s objection was more encompassing. He regarded
                  the current debate as the extreme conclusion of the misguided
                  conflation of art and morality that had long encumbered
                  British culture. To Whistler, the nude female figure, far from
                  representing immorality, embodied art in its purest, most
                  liberated, and most impractical form.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the end, the moral controversy incited by the British
                  Matron had little effect on the production of the Victorian
                  nude, as Alison Smith has argued, though it did lift the
                  artist’s model “out of the private space of the studio and
                  life class into the realm of public debate.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn68" id="page-3-fnref68" class="footnote-ref-anchor">68</a></sup>
                  Until then, the model had remained effectively invisible in
                  England. Respectable painters designed their studios with
                  separate entrances so that models could come and go without
                  being seen by other members of the household; and in the
                  context of the paintings for which they posed, models were
                  understood only in terms of the characters they impersonated.
                  “They career gaily through all centuries and through all
                  costumes,” Oscar Wilde wrote of London models, “and, like
                  actors, are only interesting when they are not
                  themselves.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn69" id="page-3-fnref69" class="footnote-ref-anchor">69</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  That paradigm was shattered in 1887, when
                  <em>The Reading Girl</em> (fig. 3.11) was exhibited at the New
                  English Art Club. The “girl” in Théodore Roussel’s painting is
                  transparently the artist’s model, who has shed, for the
                  moment, both her costume and her character. Although at work,
                  she is not working, but is “buried,” as one critic remarked,
                  “(but the British matron will regret to find not hidden) in
                  the newspaper.” Although the painting has the polish of a
                  French Salon nude, the model herself, with reddened hands and
                  calloused feet, is shockingly real. “There has been no attempt
                  to idealise the figure,” the critic continued. “It is simply a
                  portrait of a rather underfed woman, who is content (at a
                  shilling an hour) to be naked and not ashamed.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn70" id="page-3-fnref70" class="footnote-ref-anchor">70</a></sup>

                  Indeed, as with Manet’s
                  <em><a href="#page-https-www-musee-orsay-fr-fr-oeuvres-le-dejeuner-sur-lherbe-904" target="_blank">Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe</a>,</em>
                  exhibited some twenty-five years earlier, it was the model’s
                  lack of shame that most unsettled the critics. As surely as
                  her “underfed” form defied the prevailing preference for the
                  plump, her apparent ease with her own nakedness—especially in
                  the tacit presence of the artist—openly resisted the Victorian
                  ideal of femininity. “No human being, we should imagine, could
                  take any pleasure in such a picture as this,” wrote the
                  <em>Spectator</em>. “It is a degradation of Art.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn71" id="page-3-fnref71" class="footnote-ref-anchor">71</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whistler regarded <em>The Reading Girl</em> as “an
                  extraordinary picture.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn72" id="page-3-fnref72" class="footnote-ref-anchor">72</a></sup>
                  Roussel had been his “deferential disciple” since 1885,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn73" id="page-3-fnref73" class="footnote-ref-anchor">73</a></sup>
                  and during the years of their closest association they
                  explored similar subjects, employed the same models, and
                  nourished each other’s creativity. It has been suggested that
                  Whistler’s lithograph
                  <em>The Little Nude Model, Reading</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-19">cat. no. 19</a>) was made in response to Roussel’s painting, “adapting it to
                  a more spontaneous medium and intimate scale,” which may
                  certainly be the case, although the influence, it seems to me,
                  could have flowed in either direction.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn74" id="page-3-fnref74" class="footnote-ref-anchor">74</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whistler’s “little” nude (relative, perhaps, to Roussel’s big
                  one) perches on the edge of a low cabinet, attending to her
                  reading. Apart from the headscarf (which Whistler always calls
                  a cap), she wears not a stitch of clothing, though her
                  discarded draperies are heaped behind her on the tabletop; the
                  sketchy fireplace a few feet away implies the warmth that is
                  the necessary condition for posing in the nude. Like the girl
                  in Roussel’s painting, this one unwittingly draws attention to
                  herself as a <em>model,</em> as distinct from the impersonal
                  image of a generic body known simply as a <em>figure.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Indeed, from this point forward, the word “model” slips into
                  Whistler’s nomenclature, indicating the subtle shift in
                  direction we can follow in his art; the small group of
                  lithographs made in London just before 1890 depicts the model
                  outside her customary role, a strategy that allows us to
                  recognize the model behind the “figure.” Often, she is
                  portrayed at rest—absorbed in a book (<a href="#page-catalogue-18">cat. no. 18</a>), drinking tea (<a href="#page-catalogue-16">cat. no. 16</a>),
                  pulling on (or lifting off) her drapery (<a href="#page-catalogue-17">cat. no. 17</a>) as though preparing for a session that has yet to begin.
                  And even though her occupation depends on her ability to stand
                  as still as a statue, Whistler sometimes shows her in motion,
                  or at least alive to its potential. In
                  <em>The Dancing Girl</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-15">cat. no. 15</a>), for example, the model gingerly points one toe, as though
                  testing the waters; not yet prepared to abandon caution to the
                  dance, she extends one arm to release a cascade of drapery.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What we do not see in these images is evidence of
                  <em>work,</em> of models earning their hourly wage by holding
                  inauthentic attitudes under the artist’s direction. “It is the
                  secret of much of the artificiality of modern art,” wrote
                  Oscar Wilde, “this constant posing of pretty people.”
                  Whistler’s follower Mortimer Menpes confirms that the artist
                  never prescribed a pose: “There was no pulling about of
                  drapery, no gazing through arched hands, no special placing of
                  the body.” Whistler’s unusually accommodating attitude may
                  reflect his conviction that “industry in Art is a
                  necessity—not a virtue,” as he wrote in 1884, “and any
                  evidence of the same, in the production, is a blemish, not a
                  quality; a proof, not of achievement, but of absolutely
                  insufficient work, for work alone will efface the footsteps of
                  work.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn75" id="page-3-fnref75" class="footnote-ref-anchor">75</a></sup>
                  Not even the quasi-classical drapery that so often features in
                  these works performs its ostensible function. Too transparent
                  to conceal the body, too thin to keep it warm, and too generic
                  to represent a costume or disguise, the gossamer fabric simply
                  removes the model from the mundane. Formally, it enhances the
                  contours of the nude body, a trick Whistler learned from his
                  study of the Elgin Marbles. The “secret of repeated line,” as
                  he calls the device in the “Ten O’Clock,” creates “the
                  measured rhyme of lovely limb and draperies flowing in
                  unison.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn76" id="page-3-fnref76" class="footnote-ref-anchor">76</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  By doing away with poses that presume a plot and costumes that
                  identify a character, Whistler allows the model to feature as
                  an undisguised element in the process of art-making. To his
                  way of thinking, a picture of a female model is a picture of
                  nothing: a work of art without a subject, to be regarded on
                  its own terms and appreciated for its own sake—a work of art
                  about the work of art. His insubstantial little images thus
                  threatened to dispel the grand illusion supporting the
                  industry of Victorian subject painting. Edward J. Poynter, the
                  estimable director of the National Gallery and soon-to-be
                  president of the Royal Academy, confided to Whistler in 1894
                  that he had not read <em>Trilby</em>, the popular novel about
                  an artist’s model in bohemian Paris, because, he said, “I

                  Whistler’s Tanagra lithographs—like <em>Trilby</em>, but in a
                  lower key—offer up the rudiments of art, stripping away the
                  mise-en-scène and laying bare the secrets of the studio.

                <h2>The Master of the Lithograph</h2>
                <p>
                  A lithograph is a work of art on paper, printed in ink, and
                  existing in multiple examples, called impressions. Of the many
                  processes for making prints, lithography is the most direct:
                  the image is rendered on a flat stone slab just as a sketch is
                  drawn on a piece of paper. The printing method depends on the
                  simple concept that oil and water do not mix. The lithographic
                  stone is prepared so that ink will adhere only to the greasy
                  sketched lines of the image, while a film of water clings to
                  the rest of the surface, preserving a pristine background.
                  Under immense pressure, the image is transferred to sheets of
                  dampened paper, though the resulting impressions rarely show
                  signs of the force of gravity. An etching, in contrast, which
                  is printed from an incised rather than a flat surface, always
                  bears the mark of the metal plate where its sharp edges were
                  impressed into the soft paper. In a lithograph, as if by
                  magic, the drawing is replicated without leaving a trace of
                  the effort involved in its production.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn78" id="page-3-fnref78" class="footnote-ref-anchor">78</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although lithography had always held potential as an artistic
                  medium, from the time of its invention in the late eighteenth
                  century it was used primarily as a cheap means of reproducing
                  images, particularly in commercial advertisements. In England,
                  it was Thomas Way (1836–1915), a professional printer with a
                  family business in Covent Garden, who “made this matter of art
                  printing his particular affair,” as Whistler wrote in
                  retrospect, “and it is to him entirely that is due the revival
                  of artistic lithography in England.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn79" id="page-3-fnref79" class="footnote-ref-anchor">79</a></sup>
                  The two men became acquainted in 1877, when Whistler was
                  already acknowledged as a virtuoso etcher and was also at the
                  height of his powers as a painter. Within the year, Way had
                  persuaded him to give artistic lithography a try, and to their
                  mutual and continuing delight, “the master,” as Way called
                  Whistler, discovered that the medium responded “to his most
                  sensitive touch.” Although Whistler’s biographers the Pennells
                  assert that the artist adopted lithography simply because it
                  “happened to be the method of artistic expression which, at
                  the time, met his need and mood,”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn80" id="page-3-fnref80" class="footnote-ref-anchor">80</a></sup>
                  it is likely that he was also influenced by his French
                  colleagues, notably Henri Fantin-Latour and Edgar Degas, who
                  were engaged in lithographic experiments of their own.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn81" id="page-3-fnref81" class="footnote-ref-anchor">81</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whistler’s first attempts were carried out in the traditional
                  way, by drawing with a greasy lithographic crayon directly
                  onto a porous limestone slab. The resulting prints, such as
                  <em>Study</em>, 1879 (fig. 3.12), have the soft-edged look of
                  charcoal sketches, in contrast to the precise, pen-and-ink
                  appearance of an etching such as
                  <em>The Model Resting (Draped Model)</em> (see fig. 3.2). The
                  classically draped figure depicted in <em>Study,</em> the only
                  early lithograph related to the Tanagra series, stands in a
                  highly contrived, contrapposto pose. Her head, in almost
                  perfect profile, turns toward the artist’s signature
                  butterfly, which hovers conspicuously just above her elegantly
                  disposed left hand. The butterfly cipher, originally fashioned
                  as a monogram, had been used in rudimental form in
                  <em>Standing Nude</em>, 1869 (see fig. 3.1); it was to assume
                  particular importance in the formally concise lithographs, and
                  Whistler would be fastidious about its placement and
                  proportions.

                <p>
                  After <em>Study,</em> the artist abandoned his efforts in
                  lithography for nearly a decade. In 1887, when he resumed the
                  medium, he employed the more convenient method of transfer
                  lithography, which his contemporaries in France had also
                  adopted. With that technique, he could draw on specially
                  treated paper that allowed the seamless transfer of the image
                  to the stone. In the process, the composition was reversed, so
                  that when an impression was printed, the original orientation
                  of the image was restored. Despite being one step further
                  removed from the stone, the transfer lithograph was even
                  closer to the artist’s original than a print made in the
                  traditional manner. It was partly for that reason that Camille
                  Corot advanced transfer lithography as the ideal method for
                  producing multiples of drawings.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn82" id="page-3-fnref82" class="footnote-ref-anchor">82</a></sup>
                  And “from the artist’s point of view,” as Lochnan has
                  remarked, “a simpler method of printmaking could not be
                  conceived.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn83" id="page-3-fnref83" class="footnote-ref-anchor">83</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nevertheless, it took time for Whistler to master the process.
                  The commercially produced, mechanically grained transfer paper
                  was disagreeable to work with; mistakes were hard to spot and
                  tedious to correct. Because an image drawn with lithographic
                  crayon is visible only as a faint stain on transfer paper,
                  stray lines and other imperfections become apparent only when
                  a proof impression is pulled from the press.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn84" id="page-3-fnref84" class="footnote-ref-anchor">84</a></sup>
                  In <em>Model Draping</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-17">cat. no. 17</a>), for example, Whistler neglected to remove the horizontal
                  line at the model’s feet used to block out the square column
                  of her drapery; in <em>The Novel: Girl Reading</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-18">cat. no. 18</a>), the viewer can barely make out the model’s facial
                  features, and the delineation of her drapery gives way, around
                  the middle, to what can only be considered scribbling. “There
                  is nothing more difficult in art than to draw the figure,”
                  Elizabeth Pennell points out in her article on Whistler as
                  “Master of the Lithograph,” “and the difficulty is increased a
                  hundredfold when the medium is as inexorable as the
                  lithographic chalk.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn85" id="page-3-fnref85" class="footnote-ref-anchor">85</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The charm of these images easily conceals their defects: only
                  under close examination, for instance, do we discover in
                  <em>The Horoscope</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-16">cat. no. 16</a>) that the model may have three legs entangled in her
                  drapery. “<em>That</em> was a very early and bungling
                  struggle,” Whistler later had occasion to explain, “with the
                  difficulties of a new material.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn86" id="page-3-fnref86" class="footnote-ref-anchor">86</a></sup>
                  Indeed, Whistler was so disheartened by his initial
                  efforts—the first of the Tanagra lithographs—that he
                  instructed Way, by then assisted by his son, Thomas R. Way, to
                  expunge them all from their stones. Happily, this did not
                  occur, and impressions were eventually printed with the
                  artist’s approval. In Way’s estimation, the salvaged prints
                  were among Whistler’s finest—“of extreme delicacy, yet with a
                  certainty of line unsurpassed during any other period”—and the
                  artist himself named three of them among the four images on
                  the Tanagra theme that he considered “most representative—and
                  according to my own choice of quality.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn87" id="page-3-fnref87" class="footnote-ref-anchor">87</a></sup>
                  The aspect of ease that distinguishes the Tanagra lithographs
                  was therefore obtained only through unremitting effort: “The
                  work of the master,” Whistler maintained, “reeks not of the
                  sweat of the brow.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn88" id="page-3-fnref88" class="footnote-ref-anchor">88</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  According to T. R. Way, Whistler might never have persevered
                  were it not for his wife, “herself an artist of real skill,”
                  who took a particular interest in his experiments with
                  lithography, “as though she felt it offered him a field where
                  he might surpass his reputation in any other of his
                  works.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn89" id="page-3-fnref89" class="footnote-ref-anchor">89</a></sup>
                  Like so many women of her time who managed to overcome
                  cultural expectations to become artists, Beatrice (later
                  Beatrix) Philip (1856–1896) was first the daughter and then
                  the wife of one. Her father was the sculptor John Birnie
                  Philip, who died in 1875; her husband, whom she married the
                  following year, at age eighteen, was the architect and
                  “aesthetic polymath” Edward W. Godwin.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn90" id="page-3-fnref90" class="footnote-ref-anchor">90</a></sup>
                  Among her earliest works were designs for the carved bricks
                  embellishing Godwin’s Queen Anne-style buildings; she also
                  designed wallpaper and ceramic tiles, and painted decorative
                  panels for art furniture.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn91" id="page-3-fnref91" class="footnote-ref-anchor">91</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1885, Whistler—one of Godwin’s closest friends—happened to
                  see a small figure painting in oil by Beatrix and was so
                  impressed, Godwin proudly reported, that “he took it away to
                  show as the work of a pupil of his.” Her painting was
                  exhibited that year at the Society of British Artists, and
                  even though she had previously shown works under her own name
                  (or rather her husband’s, as Mrs. E. W. Godwin), Beatrix was
                  persuaded, presumably by Whistler himself, to adopt the
                  pseudonym Rix Birnie, which disguised both her gender and her
                  identity. She was also identified in the catalogue as
                  Whistler’s pupil, even though she may not yet have been.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn92" id="page-3-fnref92" class="footnote-ref-anchor">92</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Beatrix Godwin was, however, spending many hours in the
                  artist’s studio posing for her portrait,
                  <a href="#page-https-www-umis-ac-uk-artefact-james-mcneill-whistler-harmony-in-red-lamplight-c-1884-86-oil-on-canvas" target="_blank"><em>Harmony in Red: Lamplight</em></a>, in which she gazes at the artist with loving eyes. The
                  Godwins were by then estranged. His health had been failing
                  since 1885, and he died intestate in October 1886, leaving his
                  widow and their eleven-year-old son, Teddy, financially
                  insecure. Ostensibly in recognition of Edward Godwin’s “great
                  services to art in England,” Whistler started a petition to
                  raise funds “for advance to Mrs. Godwin, to enable her to take
                  an assured position as an artist.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn93" id="page-3-fnref93" class="footnote-ref-anchor">93</a></sup>
                  Perhaps supported by the magnanimity of her late husband’s
                  friends, Beatrix pursued further artistic training, briefly in
                  Paris but also in London, where Whistler taught her how to
                  etch. By 1888, she was recognized in the press as “a
                  remarkably clever artist and decorative draughtswoman,” whose
                  talents had only ripened “under the influence of the great
                  James McNeill.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn94" id="page-3-fnref94" class="footnote-ref-anchor">94</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  As part of her re-education, Beatrix Godwin made numerous
                  studies from the nude figure, working on a larger scale and in
                  a more naturalistic style than her influential mentor. The two
                  artists appear to have worked companionably in the studio,
                  sometimes from the same model. Beatrix’s
                  <em>Nude woman with an open fan</em> (fig. 3.13) might be
                  compared, for example, to Whistler’s
                  <a href="#page-https-asia-si-edu-explore-art-culture-collections-search-edanmdm-fsg-f1904-63a-c" target="_blank"><em>The Tall Flower</em></a>. The model’s pose is only slightly different, but Whistler’s
                  treatment of the nude, perhaps owing to the watercolor medium,
                  is the more delicate and tentative. Beatrix’s drawing is
                  fluent and assured. The model holds a fully opened fan by her
                  side, as if to indicate that nothing was to be concealed from
                  view; her downcast eyes imply her modesty, lending a touch of
                  irony to Beatrix’s frank image of female nudity.

                  Portsmouth in 1884, after their widowed mother was persuaded
                  that respectable artists would pay well to paint them. Their
                  first engagement was with the Royal Academician J. E. Millais,
                  who portrayed all three in
                  <a href="#page-https-artuk-org-discover-artworks-an-idyll-of-1745-102591" target="_blank"><em>An Idyll of 1745</em></a>; after that, they never wanted for work and soon became, in
                  Rosie’s words, “the best paid posers in England.” We have seen
                  Hetty, the eldest, as the model for Roussel’s
                  <em>Reading Girl</em> (fig. 3.11). She and Lily posed together
                  in a series of paintings by John William Godward, including
                  <em><a href="#page-https-www-getty-edu-art-collection-object-103ren" target="_blank">Mischief and Repose</a></em>
                  (Lily is Mischief), and for a series of

                  by the <em>Punch</em> cartoonist Linley Sambourne, who
                  sometimes posed them in the nude, relying on the images as “a
                  very useful adjunct to art” when live models were
                  unavailable.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn95" id="page-3-fnref95" class="footnote-ref-anchor">95</a></sup>

                  All three Pettigrews started working for Whistler around 1887,
                  a date we can deduce from Rosie’s memoirs, in which she slyly
                  mentions knowing “several of Whistler’s ‘wives.’” This
                  suggests that the Pettigrews’ early sittings took place while
                  Maud Franklin, the artist’s longtime model and companion, who
                  liked to be called Mrs. Whistler, was still in the
                  picture.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn96" id="page-3-fnref96" class="footnote-ref-anchor">96</a></sup>
                  The Pettigrews’ arrival in the studio coincides with the
                  commencement of the Tanagra lithographs: it was almost
                  certainly Rosie who sat, at age fifteen, for
                  <em>The Little Nude Model, Reading.</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn97" id="page-3-fnref97" class="footnote-ref-anchor">97</a></sup>
                  She also posed for <em>Peach Blossom</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-48">cat. no. 48</a>), Beatrix Godwin’s more conventional and ladylike rendition
                  of Whistler’s theme, in which the model reads her book while
                  fully clothed and seated in a proper chair. The peach-colored
                  dress (“pink, trimmed with mauve”) that in Whistlerian fashion
                  sets the picture’s color scheme was probably among the “lovely
                  little frocks” that Beatrix made for Rosie.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn98" id="page-3-fnref98" class="footnote-ref-anchor">98</a></sup>
                  “The wife I really loved,” the model wrote, “was the real
                  one.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn99" id="page-3-fnref99" class="footnote-ref-anchor">99</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whistler and Beatrix Godwin were married on August 11, 1888.
                  At age thirty-one, Beatrix had been a widow for less than two
                  years, but she was said to be bohemian, like her second
                  husband (then fifty-six), which implies that neither was
                  particularly concerned about the propriety of their
                  relationship. They had considered marriage only “in a vague
                  sort of way” before their friend Henry Labouchère intervened
                  and set the date, arranging for a quiet wedding when Maud
                  Franklin would be out of town. “Half the artist world would
                  have gone to see Mr. Whistler married,” one newspaper
                  reported, “if they had but known of it.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn100" id="page-3-fnref100" class="footnote-ref-anchor">100</a></sup>
                  The Whistlers settled into a studio flat in Tower House, one
                  of the Tite Street buildings that Godwin had designed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Beatrix fixed her affections on Rosie Pettigrew, perhaps
                  because her own child was away at school. “Mrs. Whistler loved
                  me as much as I loved her,” writes Rosie, adding, “She wanted
                  to adopt me, but mother wouldn’t hear of it.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn101" id="page-3-fnref101" class="footnote-ref-anchor">101</a></sup>
                  From the young model’s recollection of Mrs. Whistler being
                  ever present when she posed, “to my great joy,” we are given a
                  glimpse of Whistler’s studio—not at all the transactional
                  space of popular imagination, where innocent girls were
                  regularly exploited by aggressive painters, but a comfortable
                  environment contentedly occupied by three young women and
                  presided over by the artist’s wife, whose maternal care
                  modulated Whistler’s aesthetic detachment. His own presence in
                  the studio is marked only by his butterfly signature, now
                  artfully intertwined with Beatrix’s trefoil monogram. The
                  lithographs created during the years of their marriage,
                  particularly the figural works we call Tanagras, appear to be
                  the emanations of a jubilant state of mind, for as Whistler
                  declared in the “Ten O’Clock,” “Art and Joy go together.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn102" id="page-3-fnref102" class="footnote-ref-anchor">102</a></sup>
                </p>
                <h2>The Beautiful Rosies</h2>
                <p>
                  The polychrome decoration of Tanagra figurines that appears to
                  have inspired Whistler’s pastels in the 1880s may also account
                  for his experiments in color lithography, which occupied his
                  attention for three years, beginning late in 1890. His
                  ambition was to find a way to supersede the conventional
                  methods of chromolithography, in which primary colors were
                  overlaid to produce secondary hues that often ended up leaden
                  and murky. Whistler aspired to the clarity of color found in
                  Japanese woodblock prints, where brilliant hues were
                  juxtaposed, “as in a mosaic.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn103" id="page-3-fnref103" class="footnote-ref-anchor">103</a></sup>
                  Whistler’s method, according to Joseph Pennell, was to begin
                  with a single drawing on transfer paper, printed in the usual
                  way; he then would make as many drawings as there were to be
                  colors in the final print, transparent overlays keyed to the
                  master (or “keystone”) drawing. After that, the tedium began:
                  “Those parts of the drawing that are not wanted, that is all
                  but the red, for example, must be scratched or etched away,
                  and the same for the other colours.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn104" id="page-3-fnref104" class="footnote-ref-anchor">104</a></sup>
                  Finally, for each impression, a sheet of paper (antique or
                  Japanese, carefully selected by Whistler himself) would pass
                  through the press as many times as there were colors to be
                  added.
                </p>
                <p>
                  His first attempt, <em>Figure Study in Colors</em> (cat. nos.
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-20">20</a> and
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-21">21</a>), printed by Thomas Way, is
                  a straightforward image of a draped model sitting
                  uncharacteristically still, her hands clasped around one knee,
                  as though waiting patiently for something—anything—to begin.
                  Whistler inadvertently bungled the process, making two of the
                  drawings on the wrong side of the paper, and he gave up in
                  exasperation after a handful of partially colored impressions
                  emerged from the press.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn105" id="page-3-fnref105" class="footnote-ref-anchor">105</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  When he finally had the heart to try again, Whistler sought an
                  experienced color printer in Paris, where other artists of the
                  Belle Époque, such as Jules Chéret, had taken up the process
                  for poster art. On a brief trip to the Continent in June 1891,
                  Whistler met Henry Belfond, whom he considered the only person
                  in Paris to print “with intelligence and feeling.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn106" id="page-3-fnref106" class="footnote-ref-anchor">106</a></sup>
                  At Belfond’s shop in the rue Gaillon, Whistler discovered a
                  new kind of transfer paper, poor in quality but rich in
                  potential, on which he made several drawings that were
                  probably intended to be developed into color lithographs. The
                  patchy lines in <em>Nude Model, Standing</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-24">cat. no. 24</a>), for example, indicate the difficulty of drawing on the
                  finely grained paper, with the chalk skipping across the
                  slippery surface. Although he abandoned the design, a pastel
                  made around the same time, <em>Blue Girl</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-42">cat. no. 42</a>), gives us an idea of how it might have looked if Whistler
                  taken the lithograph further.
                  <em>Draped Model, Dancing</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-25">cat. no. 25</a>), another practice lithograph, shows a similarly irregular
                  quality of line, yet the dancer’s body and drapery are
                  depicted “with equal evanescence,” as Sarah Kelly notes,
                  “mingling and obscuring her form with that of the sheer
                  fabric.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn107" id="page-3-fnref107" class="footnote-ref-anchor">107</a></sup>
                  Both prints, though technical failures, possess a beauty as
                  fragile and imperfect as the delicate transfer paper on which
                  they were drawn.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A few months later, Whistler returned to Paris for a longer
                  stay, and he and Belfond worked out a system—or “arrived at a
                  solution,” as he later phrased it, “of the uncertainties of
                  colours in lithography.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn108" id="page-3-fnref108" class="footnote-ref-anchor">108</a></sup>
                  The artist would stand beside the press, mixing the oily inks
                  himself, adjusting the hues according to the shade of the
                  paper used for printing, and applying the color to the stone
                  “in the most personal manner, delicately, exquisitely.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn109" id="page-3-fnref109" class="footnote-ref-anchor">109</a></sup>
                  That deft touch, opposite in effect to the heavy-handed
                  application of commercial chromolithographs, especially
                  distinguishes <em>Draped Figure, Standing</em> (cat. nos.
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-22">22</a> and
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-23">23</a>). Drawn in France from a
                  model identified only as “Tootsie,” the figure is reminiscent
                  of a Tanagra figurine; she pulls her drapery over her head and
                  touches her hair in a gesture associated with the goddess
                  Aphrodite (fig. 3.15).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn110" id="page-3-fnref110" class="footnote-ref-anchor">110</a></sup>

                  The enhancement with color completes what Nicholas Burry Smale
                  aptly describes as “the realist subversion of the ideal.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn111" id="page-3-fnref111" class="footnote-ref-anchor">111</a></sup>
                  A more complicated image, <em>Draped Figure, Reclining</em>,
                  demonstrates Whistler’s fastidious attention to nuances of
                  color; each impression represents a variation in tonal
                  arrangement (cat. nos. <a href="#page-catalogue-30">30</a> and
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-31">31</a>). Although printed in Paris,
                  the image had been drawn in London from one of the
                  Pettigrews,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn112" id="page-3-fnref112" class="footnote-ref-anchor">112</a></sup>
                  who does not just recline in this print, as the title says,
                  but falls asleep. Originally called
                  <em>La belle dame paresseuse</em> (“the lovely, lazy lady”),
                  the lithograph is a further expression of the model
                  not-at-work, the embodiment of an art whose sole purpose is to
                  look beautiful.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn113" id="page-3-fnref113" class="footnote-ref-anchor">113</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In a related color lithograph titled
                  <em>Lady and Child</em> (fig. 3.16) (not, it should be noted,
                  “Mother and Child”), we encounter a new addition to the family
                  of Pettigrew models: Edith Gertrude, born in March 1889, the
                  fourth child of the sisters’ elder brother Alfred. The little
                  girl in her ruffled bonnet is propped on the studio sofa with
                  a yellow toy of some sort in her lap; she gazes steadily at
                  the artist while her aunt, nearly unrecognizable in street
                  clothes and a bergère hat, takes the opportunity to rest her
                  eyes. In <em>Cameo, No. 1</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-39">cat. no. 39</a>), a rare etching from this period that was originally titled
                  <em>Little Edith</em>,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn114" id="page-3-fnref114" class="footnote-ref-anchor">114</a></sup>
                  it is the baby who is coaxed to nap by her loving aunt, all
                  draped up and ready for work; in <em>Cameo, No. 2</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-40">cat. no. 40</a>), the baby sleeps. Whistler also made several drawings of
                  Edith with her Pettigrew relation (probably Rosie) on transfer
                  paper, presumably meant as keystone drawings for color prints.
                  As with the single-figure Tanagra lithographs, the models
                  appear to have been free to do whatever they pleased—play,
                  sit, cuddle, or sleep—while the artist waited for the pose
                  that formed the picture.

                  The first of the four transfer lithographs titled
                  <em>Mother and Child</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-26">cat. no. 26</a>) can be dated to June 1891 because the old
                  <em>papier viennois</em> on which it is drawn makes it
                  contemporary with the two Cameo etchings. The other three, all
                  horizontal, must have been made later in the year, as they are
                  drawn on the tissue-thin <em>papier végétal</em> that Whistler
                  brought back with him that summer from Paris (cat. nos.
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-27">27</a>,
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-28">28</a>, and
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-29">29</a>). Whistler fell out with
                  Belfond before the drawings could be developed into color
                  lithographs and they were put away, but not forgotten. At
                  Beatrix’s request, the drawings were retrieved in 1895, and
                  impressions were printed in London by the Ways with varying
                  degrees of success. Only then was the perfunctory title
                  <em>Mother and Child</em> assigned to every picture in the
                  series.

                  Had they evolved as originally intended, the images would more
                  closely resemble Whistler’s pastels on the same theme, such as
                  <a href="#page-https-asia-si-edu-explore-art-culture-collections-search-edanmdm-fsg-f1894-27a-c" target="_blank"><em>Rose and Red: The Little Pink Cap</em></a>, <em>The Purple Cap</em> (fig. 3.17),

                  effects, not indicative of generic subjects. The serial title
                  makes it easy to overlook the individual qualities of the
                  lithographs, but Pennell, probably encouraged by Whistler,
                  singled out the second of the four (<a href="#page-catalogue-28">cat. no. 28</a>) in her <em>Scribner’s</em> article. Simply titled
                  <em>Mother and Child,</em> it forms the headpiece and is
                  praised in terms both technical and art-historical, as being
                  “instinct with maternal devotion as the Madonnas of Bellini or
                  Fra Angelico, the plump nakedness of the child a marvel of
                  masterly execution, of eloquent form.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn115" id="page-3-fnref115" class="footnote-ref-anchor">115</a></sup>

                  How can we account for the efflorescence of this sentimental
                  theme in nearly every medium of Whistler’s practice during
                  this late period of his career? It is possible that he found
                  inspiration in the Tanagras called <em>kourotrophoi,</em> or
                  “child nurturers,” mortal women or divinities shown with an
                  infant or small child (<a href="#page-catalogue-7">cat. no. 7</a>). “The Tanagra potter was particularly happy in his
                  renderings of figures or scenes in which gentle grace
                  predominates,” observed the Victorian writer Caroline A.
                  Hutton, citing an example in the British Museum possessed of
                  “all the sweet serenity of a mediæval Madonna.” (That figurine
                  has been revealed to be
                  <a href="#page-https-www-britishmuseum-org-collection-object-g-1877-0515-10" target="_blank">a reconstruction</a>, with a pretty young head appended to the body of an elderly
                  nursemaid.)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn116" id="page-3-fnref116" class="footnote-ref-anchor">116</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  More often advanced as precedents for Whistler’s lithographic
                  theme are the comparatively ornate statuettes of Aphrodite and
                  Eros, particularly
                  <a href="#page-https-wellcomecollection-org-works-p2gh6hhs-items-canvas-50-and-query-eros" target="_blank">an example</a>
                  in the Ionides collection in which the figures are
                  recumbent.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn117" id="page-3-fnref117" class="footnote-ref-anchor">117</a></sup>
                  (Although it would not have mattered to Whistler, that now
                  unlocated figurine was almost certainly a modern forgery.)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn118" id="page-3-fnref118" class="footnote-ref-anchor">118</a></sup>
                  According to Olivier Rayet, the coroplasts were simply
                  developing a theme frequently explored by poets of the fourth
                  and third centuries, of love (in the form of Eros) attempting
                  to fly away from the beautiful young woman who tries to hold
                  onto it. One example shown at the 1878 Exposition Universelle
                  in Paris, in which a seated draped figure plays with the naked
                  baby in her lap (<a href="#page-catalogue-50">cat. no. 50</a>),
                  might plausibly relate to Whistler’s
                  <em>Mother and Child, No. 1</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-26">cat. no. 26</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn119" id="page-3-fnref119" class="footnote-ref-anchor">119</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although Whistler was purging subject matter from his art, in
                  the Tanagra renditions of the mother-and-child theme he may
                  have recognized a relevant reconciliation of the human with
                  the divine. Marcus Huish, in 1900, imagines a Tanagra potter
                  charged with representing the “Goddess Mother” but finding
                  little inspiration in the traditional type, while “in his own
                  house, he had in his wife and infant one surpassing anything
                  that he could imagine. If he possessed any artistic sense, he
                  would be moved to translate this into clay.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn120" id="page-3-fnref120" class="footnote-ref-anchor">120</a></sup>
                  In the same way, perhaps, Whistler recognized the mortal
                  equivalents of his own muse, the being he considers the
                  goddess of art, in the blithe young models who had the run of
                  his studio.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whistler might also have looked for inspiration to
                  contemporary works for inspiration. His fellow American
                  expatriate Mary Cassatt, for example, was experimenting with
                  color printing at this very moment, and an aquatint such as
                  <em>After the Bath</em> (fig. 3.18) approximates the quiet
                  sensuality of Whistler’s works.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn121" id="page-3-fnref121" class="footnote-ref-anchor">121</a></sup>
                  It is important to recognize that Cassatt’s figures, like
                  Whistler’s, were based on hired models who were not
                  necessarily related to the children they appear to mother. The
                  maternal theme was a culturally appropriate way to express
                  ideas about artistic creativity, especially for women artists,
                  though Whistler himself once relied on the metaphor to
                  describe the process of art-making: “It’s the pain of giving
                  birth!”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn122" id="page-3-fnref122" class="footnote-ref-anchor">122</a></sup>
                  But the overarching theme of Whistler’s imagery, as Katharine
                  Lochnan acknowledged, is probably not motherhood in itself,
                  but the notion of “woman as nurturer,”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn123" id="page-3-fnref123" class="footnote-ref-anchor">123</a></sup>
                  the Greek <em>kourotrophos</em>. If we accept Whistler’s
                  Tanagra images as the embodiments, or evocations, of his
                  muse—the “loving and fruitful” goddess described in the “Ten
                  O’Clock”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn124" id="page-3-fnref124" class="footnote-ref-anchor">124</a></sup>—then the infant cared for so tenderly in the sheltered space
                  of the studio may be considered the exquisite creation of the
                  artist’s hand, the work of art itself.

                  However they might have been understood by Whistler’s
                  contemporaries, these charming images would seem the most
                  likely of all his works to appeal to popular taste. Yet
                  Whistler rarely exhibited the mother-and-child pastels, and he
                  printed the related lithographs in tiny editions. Of the
                  handful that were sold, nearly all went to Charles Lang Freer,
                  his highly sympathetic patron in Detroit. The majority
                  remained in Whistler’s studio at the time of his death.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whistler and Beatrix seem to have regarded these works as a
                  kind of joint endeavor, like aesthetic offspring, perhaps
                  inspired by the ambiance of affection they created in the
                  studio. To them, the images were highly personal, deeply
                  private, and deliberately recondite. We see this in the
                  letters written by the artist during his quick trip to Paris
                  in June 1891, while the series was still in progress. Whistler
                  reports to Beatrix on his visit to the gallery of Paul
                  Durand-Ruel to view recent works by his Parisian
                  contemporaries. “There is a little room full of Renoirs—You
                  have no idea! I <em>don’t</em> know what has happened to the
                  eyes of every body—The things are simply <em>childish</em>—and
                  a Degas absolutely shameful!” Had they been together, he wrote
                  to his wife, they would have held hands and summoned the
                  memory of “the beautiful Rosies,” or Pettigrew pastels,
                  presumably as a defense against bad art. Because they were
                  apart, Whistler advised Beatrix to retrieve the delicate works
                  from the cabinet in the studio where they were kept and handle
                  them with care. “Take the two drawers, just as they are, and
                  carry them up stairs—don’t let them be shaken, and cover them
                  over with a little drapery and wait till I come back—We have
                  no idea how precious they are!”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn125" id="page-3-fnref125" class="footnote-ref-anchor">125</a></sup>
                </p>
                <h2>The Pinnacle of Fame</h2>
                <p>
                  For those who know Whistler only as the author of the square
                  and somber portrait of his mother, the drawings of lithe young
                  women entwined with naked babies can be difficult to
                  assimilate. The puzzle is only compounded when we learn that
                  <em><a href="#page-https-artsandculture-google-com-asset-portrait-of-the-artist-s-mother-2qh4inlxwx6umq-hl-en" target="_blank">Arrangement in Grey and Black</a></em>
                  (“Whistler’s Mother”) was in the Whistlers’ new London home at
                  21 Cheyne Walk in 1891, while the “Rosies” were in progress.
                  “It was hung rather low,” their parlor maid recollected, “and
                  looked for all the world like life and seemed too natural for
                  a picture.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn126" id="page-3-fnref126" class="footnote-ref-anchor">126</a></sup>
                  Yet Whistler’s variations on the theme of motherhood, created
                  decades apart, in diverse media and on a vastly different
                  scale, identically express his wish to liberate art from the
                  expectations of convention. The portrait of his mother, as he
                  explained around this time to the artist Henry Tonks,
                  naturally possessed interest for him, “as he was very fond of
                  her.” To anyone else, Whistler said, shifting the emphasis
                  from sentimental subject to formal abstraction, “its beauty
                  could be just as well seen if they looked at it upside
                  down.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn127" id="page-3-fnref127" class="footnote-ref-anchor">127</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whistler’s Mother was the key that unlocked the artist’s
                  lasting renown. In November 1891, it was purchased for the
                  Luxembourg in Paris, the national collection of works by
                  living artists, which destined the portrait, eventually, for
                  the Louvre. Its acquisition by the French state set off a
                  series of exhibitions and accolades that finally secured
                  Whistler’s stature as an artist. As du Maurier noted in
                  <em>Trilby</em>, “He is now perched on such a topping pinnacle
                  (of fame and notoriety combined) that people can stare at him
                  from two hemispheres at once.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn128" id="page-3-fnref128" class="footnote-ref-anchor">128</a></sup>
                  Responding to the demands of his rising reputation, Whistler
                  was also living in two cities at once, making frequent trips
                  across the English Channel, but by March 1892, he was ready to
                  leave England for good, as his “strongest art sympathies,” he
                  announced, were centered in Paris.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn129" id="page-3-fnref129" class="footnote-ref-anchor">129</a></sup>
                  In England that year, Whistler’s French success was regarded
                  with suspicion until it was categorically confirmed by the
                  stunning retrospective of his paintings,
                  <em>Nocturnes, Marines, and Chevalet Pieces</em>, at the
                  Goupil Gallery. As D. C. Thomson wrote to Beatrix Whistler,
                  then in Paris, “To those who have eyes to see, &amp;
                  fortunately they are increasing in number, the collection is
                  the most notable event that has taken place in London for many
                  many years &amp; it will stand out for all future times as one
                  of the epochs of art in this country.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn130" id="page-3-fnref130" class="footnote-ref-anchor">130</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Seeking out the artist at the Goupil exhibition, a reporter
                  for the <em>Illustrated London News</em> referred to a rumor
                  that Whistler had “invented a new process of lithography.”
                  Whistler demurred, “I am simply busy with some coloured
                  lithographs, which will be seen by-and-bye.” The “new
                  process,” he said, was only “a return to simplicity,”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn131" id="page-3-fnref131" class="footnote-ref-anchor">131</a></sup>
                  but that may have been wishful thinking, for the permanent
                  move to Paris had greatly complicated Whistler’s lithographic
                  practice. While he continued working with Belfond on color
                  lithographs, he relied on the Ways to print the monochrome
                  impressions: “These things are of great delicacy, and I could
                  not dream of running risks in other hands.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn132" id="page-3-fnref132" class="footnote-ref-anchor">132</a></sup>
                  Rolled up in periodicals for protection, Whistler’s
                  transfer-paper drawings were regularly posted to London, along
                  with extensive instructions for the Ways: “Of course more
                  margin at the bottom than at the top. About paper—the white
                  you sent, is <em>rather</em> too white.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn133" id="page-3-fnref133" class="footnote-ref-anchor">133</a></sup>
                  Their richly detailed correspondence illuminates what T. R.
                  Way regarded as “one long series of experiments, so frequently
                  did he vary his materials and his manner of using them.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn134" id="page-3-fnref134" class="footnote-ref-anchor">134</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The most consequential development in this period may have
                  been Whistler’s adoption of the <em>crayon estompe,</em> or
                  “stump,” a tool made of paper wound tightly into a stick, or
                  stump, and suffused with tusche, a liquid drawing medium.
                  Whistler discovered that the stump imparted a particular
                  richness to his drawings, “a certain velvety daintiness—quite
                  unlike anything I have ever seen.” The effect is especially
                  striking in a pair of lithographs from 1893, referred to by
                  the artist in typical shorthand as “the lying down figure” (<a href="#page-catalogue-34">cat. no. 34</a>) and “the sitting figure” (<a href="#page-catalogue-33">cat. no. 33</a>). Both were drawn from the same model, a young Italian named
                  Carmen Rossi (born around 1878)—“a nice little Rosie,” as
                  Whistler described her to Beatrix—who had turned up at
                  Whistler’s Paris studio one day in January 1892. Together, the
                  lithographs mark an important advance in Whistler’s process.
                  “I am getting to use the stump just like a brush,” he informed
                  Way, “and the work is beginning to have the mystery in
                  execution of a painting.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn135" id="page-3-fnref135" class="footnote-ref-anchor">135</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In <em>Nude Model, Reclining</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-34">cat. no. 34</a>), the heavy somnolence that had suffused
                  <em>Draped Figure Reclining</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-31">cat. no. 31</a>), the color lithograph from the previous year, has given way
                  to an atmosphere charged with possibility. The model’s quirky
                  pose—head supported by one elbow while the other arm tents the
                  drapery above one hip—could not have been maintained for long:
                  as MacDonald has observed, “The brevity of this glimpse of the
                  naked body is emphasized by the conciseness of the
                  technique.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn136" id="page-3-fnref136" class="footnote-ref-anchor">136</a></sup>
                  The unusual disposition of the model’s legs may derive from a
                  painting in the National Gallery, Tintoretto’s
                  <em><a href="#page-https-www-nationalgallery-org-uk-paintings-jacopo-tintoretto-the-origin-of-the-milky-way" target="_blank">Origin of the Milky Way</a>,</em>
                  of which Whistler kept photographs in the studio.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn137" id="page-3-fnref137" class="footnote-ref-anchor">137</a></sup>
                  Although it is difficult to reconcile the quiet languor of
                  Whistler's image with the frenzy of Tintoretto’s scene—Hera’s
                  hectic suckling of the infant Herakles just before she repels
                  him in pain and spews divine milk across the heavens to
                  accidentally create the Milky Way—the visual quotation may
                  have been meant especially for Beatrix, as
                  <em>The Origin of the Milky Way</em> was her favorite
                  painting.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn138" id="page-3-fnref138" class="footnote-ref-anchor">138</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the second of the pair (<a href="#page-catalogue-32">cat no. 32</a>), the model has risen to a seated position on the
                  Empire-style sofa, though she seems even less alert than when
                  she was recumbent. Seated Tanagra figurines are rare, but
                  Whistler’s <em>Draped Figure, Seated</em> may have been
                  inspired by a lovely figurine purchased for the Louvre in 1876
                  (since identified as a forgery) of a
                  <a href="#page-https-collections-louvre-fr-en-ark-53355-cl010280752" target="_blank">woman seated on a rock</a>. As one contemporary scholar helpfully pointed out, “rocks
                  cannot have been used as furniture among the Greeks,” so the
                  rustic setting may identify the figure as a muse at rest in
                  the natural world.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn139" id="page-3-fnref139" class="footnote-ref-anchor">139</a></sup>
                  Whistler’s draped figure is more luxuriously situated in the
                  studio, with the suggestion of a folding screen behind the
                  couch. Her body forms a sturdy pyramid, though one of her
                  legs, slightly bent, suggests that she might attempt,
                  unsteadily, to stand. In a telling visual echo of the
                  Tanagra’s gracefully bowed head, the dark halo of the modern
                  model’s hair and scarf shadows her downcast eyes, conjuring a
                  sense of the semi-conscious, that hazy borderland between
                  wakefulness and sleep, making her appear, like the terracotta,
                  as if lost in a dream.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This was the figure that Whistler selected to represent his
                  art in a portfolio of prints called
                  <em>L’Estampe originale.</em> The publisher, André Marty, was
                  the leading advocate of artistic lithography in France, and
                  even though, as Whistler explained to T. R. Way, “there is as
                  usual no money in the matter for <em>me</em>,” the lithograph
                  would appear in the distinguished company of works by such
                  artists as Pierre Puvis de Chavannes and Félix Bracquemond—and
                  so, Whistler decided, “Let us be very swell among them all.”
                  Marty himself collected Whistler’s drawing in Paris and
                  hand-delivered it to the Ways in London, also providing a ream
                  of <em>gampi torinoko</em>, the sturdy Japanese paper on which
                  a hundred impressions were printed. The resulting proofs,
                  according to the artist, were “absolutely perfect.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn140" id="page-3-fnref140" class="footnote-ref-anchor">140</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  As published in <em>L’Estampe originale</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-33">cat. no. 33</a>), the lithograph was unaccountably called
                  <em>Danseuse</em> (“Dancer”); perhaps Georges Vicaire, who
                  catalogued the prints in 1897, detected an affinity with a
                  Tanagra dancer, such as the <em>Danseuse Titeux</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-1">cat. no. 1</a>), and imagined her in repose. Whistler himself gave one
                  title to the lithograph in 1894—<em>The Seated Draped Figure</em>—when he sent an impression to London for exhibition at the
                  Grafton Gallery, and quite another when the lithograph went on
                  view with the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts:
                  <em>La Songeuse</em>, or “Daydreamer.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn141" id="page-3-fnref141" class="footnote-ref-anchor">141</a></sup>
                  In fin de siècle France, that title positioned Whistler
                  decisively within the Symbolist circle. French Symbolism was
                  in many ways aligned with the aestheticism that Whistler had
                  long espoused. The movement was a reaction to the art of
                  description that had prevailed throughout the nineteenth
                  century in the various forms of naturalism, Realism, and
                  Impressionism. Seeking something more elusive—essence rather
                  than substance or even appearance—the Symbolists fashioned
                  complex metaphors to suggest (but never describe) the faint
                  correspondences they detected between the material and the
                  spiritual. Their esoteric art was ambiguous by design.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn142" id="page-3-fnref142" class="footnote-ref-anchor">142</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Stéphane Mallarmé (1842–1898), the poet credited with endowing
                  the Symbolist movement “with a sense of the mysterious and
                  ineffable,” had provided a French translation of Whistler’s
                  “Ten O’Clock” in 1888, affirming his own sympathy with the
                  artist’s aestheticist vision.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn143" id="page-3-fnref143" class="footnote-ref-anchor">143</a></sup>
                  In return—as a symbol, so to speak, of their consonant
                  “aesthetic of implication”—Whistler presented Mallarmé with an
                  impression of <em>The Dancing Girl</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-15">cat. no. 15</a>),<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn144" id="page-3-fnref144" class="footnote-ref-anchor">144</a></sup>
                  one of the first of his Tanagra lithographs. From the
                  Symbolist point of view, the dance is the ideal art form, “a
                  purely visual text that is fleeting and transitory,” as Sarah
                  Kelly observes, which finds a parallel in Whistler’s ephemeral
                  lithographs. Moreover, as an instinctive, spontaneous
                  expression of joy, dance is an apposite symbol of the creative
                  impulse,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn145" id="page-3-fnref145" class="footnote-ref-anchor">145</a></sup>
                  and Mallarmé reciprocated with “Billet à Whistler,” a sonnet
                  in which art is personified as a dancer twirling through
                  space, “a muslin whirlwind.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn146" id="page-3-fnref146" class="footnote-ref-anchor">146</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Imbued with art and friendship, Whistler’s contented Parisian
                  life found expression in his lithographs—notably the images of
                  his muse, who regularly communed with the artist at his new
                  studio in Montparnasse (fig. 3.19). On the sixth floor of a
                  modern building in the old-world street of
                  Notre-Dame-des-Champs, the studio was “really perhaps the
                  finest thing of the kind I have ever seen,” Whistler informed
                  his sister-in-law.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn147" id="page-3-fnref147" class="footnote-ref-anchor">147</a></sup>
                  Its perfection was confirmed by Robert Sherard, the English
                  journalist who visited the artist in Paris in 1893, though he
                  was surprised to discover that apart from the printing press,
                  “the only commercial-looking thing in all the place,” there
                  were no signs of work in the studio, “no easel visible, not
                  one palette, none of the charming litter of the art.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn148" id="page-3-fnref148" class="footnote-ref-anchor">148</a></sup>
                  It was as if Whistler were encouraging the production of art
                  by denying the existence of labor, effacing “the footsteps of
                  work” not only from his artistic inventions, but from his
                  professional domain. The house in the rue du Bac, too, where
                  he and Beatrix had taken up residence, was an ideal setting
                  for aestheticism, “a sort of little fairy palace,” as Whistler
                  described it, “—a thing on a fan—or on a blue plate.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn149" id="page-3-fnref149" class="footnote-ref-anchor">149</a></sup>

                  Everyone agreed that the artist had never been happier than
                  during this interlude in Paris, “when he was acknowledged and
                  taken seriously as a <em>maître d’école,</em> and found his
                  work appreciated and sought for by collectors.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn150" id="page-3-fnref150" class="footnote-ref-anchor">150</a></sup>
                  His recent successes in lithography caused him to perceive the
                  medium as defining his future prospects. “I fancy I see
                  fortune looming on the horizon,” he wrote to Way in London,
                  “and I might really be rich!” He had “endless things” in mind,
                  he said, ideas that had been bottled up throughout “the hard
                  siege and open war” of his previous, beleaguered life in
                  London. One of those “things” was
                  <em>Little Draped Figure, Leaning</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-35">cat. no. 35</a>), another in the series of lithographs drawn from Carmen
                  Rossi late in 1893, which Whistler regarded as “a really
                  delightful little drawing on paper,” by which he meant a
                  transfer drawing intended for the lithographic stone, “unless
                  I deceive myself greatly—Very simple and very fair.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn151" id="page-3-fnref151" class="footnote-ref-anchor">151</a></sup>
                  It revives a favored compositional type dating back twenty
                  years, and may be regarded as a languid rendition of the early
                  lithograph <em>Study</em> (fig. 3.12). The model is more
                  relaxed, legs crossed at the knee, arms resting lightly on the
                  rail behind her, assuming an attitude that vaguely recalls the
                  standard Tanagra type of the semi-nude Aphrodite leaning
                  nonchalantly against a pillar (<a href="#page-catalogue-10">cat. no. 10</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn152" id="page-3-fnref152" class="footnote-ref-anchor">152</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whistler repeated the motif some months later in a drawing of
                  a leaning figure striking the same chiastic pose (<a href="#page-catalogue-36">cat. no. 36</a>). The drapery is as transparent as that in the previous
                  image, where it is seen clearly only in the gathers forming a
                  pattern against the wall; in
                  <em>Little Draped Figure, Leaning</em>, the drapery forms a
                  more emphatic element of the composition, not altogether
                  successfully. Whistler had his doubts about the drawing, along
                  with another made at the same time (<a href="#page-catalogue-37">cat. no. 37</a>), which depicts the model from behind: facing the studio
                  armchair instead of the artist, she lifts her gauzy drapery
                  overhead in a pose possibly inspired by Watteau.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn153" id="page-3-fnref153" class="footnote-ref-anchor">153</a></sup>
                  Titled <em>Study</em> by default, the lithograph recalls the
                  early, experimental <em>Model Draping</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-17">cat. no. 17</a>), one of the first works for which Rosie Pettigrew had
                  posed, showing Whistler’s fascination with the graceful
                  movements by which she donned her drapery.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn154" id="page-3-fnref154" class="footnote-ref-anchor">154</a></sup>
                  In contrast, the unnamed model who posed for these Parisian
                  pictures was “rather a poor one,” Whistler wrote to Way in
                  explanation of these imperfect drawings, an excuse that
                  betrays the importance he continued to attach to his model as
                  muse. Whistler’s dissatisfaction only deepened when he
                  received trial proofs, noting that the images needed
                  “cleaning.” In the end, he must have regarded them both as
                  beyond redemption, for no revisions were ever made and the
                  stones were erased after a small number of proofs was pulled
                  from the press.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn155" id="page-3-fnref155" class="footnote-ref-anchor">155</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  And yet, Whistler wrote brightly to Thomson, “the lithographs
                  are daily becoming more perfect.” Accordingly, he raised his
                  prices. He had tried to appeal to a wider public by making the
                  prints available “at an absurdly small price,” but they had
                  attracted only “the same small clientele” that dependably
                  purchased his more expensive etchings. Why, he wondered, had
                  he ever thought “the ‘masses’ would rush in” just because he
                  set the cost of his works within their means?<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn156" id="page-3-fnref156" class="footnote-ref-anchor">156</a></sup>
                  To the writer for the <em>Studio</em> who interviewed Whistler
                  around this time, the artist avowed that he did not make
                  prints for popular consumption: “Art is the worst aristocrat
                  of all,” he declared. “It has nothing to do with the
                  masses.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn157" id="page-3-fnref157" class="footnote-ref-anchor">157</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Though impressing the <em>Studio</em> journalist with his
                  “intimate knowledge of all the conventions and tricks of the
                  craft,” Whistler described himself with rare humility as a
                  beginner in the field of lithography: “There is a lot to be
                  done yet.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn158" id="page-3-fnref158" class="footnote-ref-anchor">158</a></sup>
                  He still harbored hopes that he might “have another go with
                  colour” at the Ways’ establishment in London, and he felt
                  certain that “the fun and the mystery” of the medium would
                  “begin in <em>earnest</em>” as soon as he discovered the
                  perfect transfer paper.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn159" id="page-3-fnref159" class="footnote-ref-anchor">159</a></sup>
                  He was experimenting with the perfectly smooth, transparent
                  sheets of tracing paper used for making facsimiles of
                  handwritten documents. Extremely thin and hard to handle, the
                  paper nonetheless produced “a certain softness of quality,
                  almost at times a blurred effect,” as T. R. Way allowed;
                  because the glassy surface offered no resistance, the images
                  drawn upon it convey an uncanny sense of the chalk gliding
                  across the sheet, “exactly as his mind has directed it.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn160" id="page-3-fnref160" class="footnote-ref-anchor">160</a></sup>
                  These lithographs, especially, show no trace of effort, no
                  footstep of work. “The line comes
                  <em>straight from his pencil</em>,” Whistler wrote, insisting
                  that a transfer lithograph would either perfectly represent
                  his intentions or betray him utterly, “in his weakness and
                  incapacity.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn161" id="page-3-fnref161" class="footnote-ref-anchor">161</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The last of the Tanagra lithographs,
                  <em>Girl with Bowl</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-38">cat. no. 38</a>), represents the latter outcome—or so it appeared to
                  Whistler’s American dealer Edward G. Kennedy, who feared that
                  the lithograph could only damage Whistler’s reputation. Its
                  cringing awkwardness was invisible to Whistler, however, who
                  replied to Kennedy with surprising equanimity that the
                  objectionable print had been “a great success in Paris.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn162" id="page-3-fnref162" class="footnote-ref-anchor">162</a></sup>
                  The lithograph had been made expressly for a short-lived
                  Symbolist art journal titled <em>L’Ymagier.</em> In efforts to
                  unsettle the traditional hierarchies of artistic genres, and
                  to question the distinction between copies and originals, the
                  quarterly juxtaposed contemporary works by artists such as
                  Paul Gauguin and Émile Bernard with medieval woodcuts and
                  popular imagery from Épinal prints. Whistler’s lithograph,
                  which appeared in an issue featuring articles on monsters and
                  Saint Nicholas, followed reproductions of woodcuts by Lucas
                  Cranach the Elder.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn163" id="page-3-fnref163" class="footnote-ref-anchor">163</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In that eccentric panoply of prints,
                  <em>Girl with Bowl</em> may show to best advantage. Whistler
                  himself maintained a peculiar affection for it, naming the
                  print among the few “choice” examples of his lithographs of
                  nude and draped figures.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn164" id="page-3-fnref164" class="footnote-ref-anchor">164</a></sup>
                  The standing model holds at her hip a porcelain vessel, an
                  unprecedented prop in a lithograph though the bowl turns up in
                  several other works on paper from this period, often as a
                  container for a potted plant. In <em>Spring</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-41">cat. no. 41</a>), for instance, a glossy, white porcelain bowl emblazoned
                  with a butterfly set inside a trefoil holds a flowering plant,
                  presumably of some variety too rarefied to blossom in the
                  common garden soil. In contrast, the vessel in
                  <em>Girl with Bowl</em> remains empty, as if waiting to hold
                  some symbolic significance.

                  Beatrix, by then, had fallen ill with cancer; the Whistlers’
                  Parisian idyll was over. The blow seemed even crueler,
                  Whistler confided to Kennedy, because it came “just as ease
                  &amp; success—and even power &amp; perhaps even knowledge
                  seemed to be smiling upon us.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn165" id="page-3-fnref165" class="footnote-ref-anchor">165</a></sup>
                  In pursuit of medical attention, the Whistlers packed up their
                  Paris home and returned unhappily to London, where the artist
                  immersed himself in work, the only refuge for his abstracted
                  mind. Thomas Wilmer Dewing, an American artist whom Whistler
                  had recently met through Freer, their mutual patron, spent
                  some dark days that winter with Whistler in a borrowed studio
                  in Fitzroy Street. During that quiet period of the artists’
                  intimacy, Dewing drew his own draped model in pastel,
                  <em>Figure in Grey and Pink Drapery</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-43">cat. no. 43</a>). If the medium, motif, and brown paper owe much to
                  Whistler’s influence, the model’s insouciant attitude, as
                  Susan Hobbs has noted, is again reminiscent of Tanagra
                  figurines.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn166" id="page-3-fnref166" class="footnote-ref-anchor">166</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lithography was the one medium Whistler was able to practice
                  during the desperate days of Beatrix’s illness. T. R. Way
                  remembered how Whistler insisted that proofs be pulled at once
                  of each new drawing so he could show Beatrix what had been
                  accomplished during their time apart. To Way, this resolve
                  only confirmed her crucial importance to Whistler’s
                  lithographic enterprise.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn167" id="page-3-fnref167" class="footnote-ref-anchor">167</a></sup>
                  It is a sad irony that while Beatrix lay dying, Whistler’s
                  reputation ascended as he became recognized as the leading
                  exponent of artistic lithography; her decline exactly
                  coincided with the centenary of lithography’s invention, when
                  “a craft that had gone into trade,” as one journalist
                  described the renaissance, “takes its place again among the
                  aristocracy of the portfolio.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn168" id="page-3-fnref168" class="footnote-ref-anchor">168</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  For <em>Centenaire de la lithographie</em>, the enormous
                  exhibition staged in Paris that autumn, the Ways selected six
                  prints on Whistler’s behalf that they believed to demonstrate
                  the variety of his work “from a technical point of view.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn169" id="page-3-fnref169" class="footnote-ref-anchor">169</a></sup>
                  Whistler himself was spending those months in Lyme Regis with
                  Beatrix (“still far from well”), but even in that remote
                  locale he heard “that <em>everyone</em> is much agog about
                  lithography and that the Paris Lithographic Exhibition is
                  attracting great attention.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn170" id="page-3-fnref170" class="footnote-ref-anchor">170</a></sup>
                  Not to be outdone, London was to have an exhibition of its
                  own, even though few artists in England were seriously engaged
                  with the medium. Marcus Huish, who was the director of the
                  Fine Art Society, where Whistler had long exhibited prints and
                  pastels, wrote to Whistler that it seemed a pity for amateur
                  practitioners, even if they were Royal Academicians, to be
                  soaking up the glory while “the originator of the revival
                  here” was getting insufficient credit. To balance the scales,
                  Huish proposed an exhibition dedicated entirely to Whistler’s
                  work in lithography.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn171" id="page-3-fnref171" class="footnote-ref-anchor">171</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  To Whistler at that time, an exhibition sounded like a lot of
                  trouble, “and I am awfully handicapped with trouble
                  already.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn172" id="page-3-fnref172" class="footnote-ref-anchor">172</a></sup>
                  Eventually, if reluctantly, he was persuaded, and an
                  exhibition of seventy-one lithographs opened on December 7,
                  1896, at the galleries in New Bond Street.
                  <em>Mr. Whistler’s Lithographs</em> was an instant and utter
                  success. The artist’s longtime friend Ernest G. Brown, who
                  worked with Huish at the Fine Art Society, wrote to Whistler
                  about the artists and connoisseurs—including the Prince of
                  Wales—who were flocking to see the lithographs, “generally
                  considered the very best things you have done. There is no
                  doubt of your popularity now.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn173" id="page-3-fnref173" class="footnote-ref-anchor">173</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In February 1896, when Whistler himself finally wrote to gloat
                  to Kennedy about the exhibition, he and Beatrix were back in
                  London: “Really it will make you quite jealous—for the success
                  was quite stupendous.” Yet the brisk sales, brilliant reviews,
                  continual commendations, all were as nothing, he said, “beside
                  the health of our Lady, in whose happiness is all our hope
                  &amp; joy &amp; invention.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn174" id="page-3-fnref174" class="footnote-ref-anchor">174</a></sup>
                  In hopes that a change of scene might lift their spirits, the
                  Whistlers took a room on an upper floor of the Savoy Hotel,
                  where Beatrix could look out on the river from a chaise longue
                  set beside the window. Whistler worked by her side, consoling
                  himself with views of the Thames in drawings destined for the
                  lithographic stone: “I am now doing the best work of that
                  kind, by far, that I have ever done,” he wrote to Kennedy.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn175" id="page-3-fnref175" class="footnote-ref-anchor">175</a></sup>
                  He also portrayed Beatrix in bed, poignant images that reveal
                  the gravity of her illness (fig. 3.20), even though he could
                  not face up to it himself: he named one of those portraits,
                  optimistically, <em>La belle dame convalescente.</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn176" id="page-3-fnref176" class="footnote-ref-anchor">176</a></sup>

                  After Beatrix died in May, Whistler’s interest in lithography
                  faded away.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn177" id="page-3-fnref177" class="footnote-ref-anchor">177</a></sup>
                  At the end of his own life, however, he returned to the nude
                  figure, this time in a series of small oil paintings. The one
                  he particularly prized was
                  <em>Purple and Gold: Phyrne the Superb!—Builder of Temples</em>
                  (fig. 3.21), begun by January 1898 but still in his
                  studio—perhaps still in progress—when he died in July 1903.
                  Its unusually detailed, allusive, and enthusiastic title
                  announces the subject’s importance: Phryne was the legendary
                  Greek (indeed, Boeotian) courtesan who had the means to
                  rebuild the city of Thebes after its destruction by Alexander

                  starting to be made in the neighboring town of Tanagra. It was
                  Phryne, too, who posed for the sculptor Praxiteles as the
                  Aphrodite of Knidos (ca. 360–330 BCE), the first life-size
                  female nude in antiquity (fig. 1.10).

                <p>
                  Whistler’s modest portrait belies its imposing title. First,
                  it is painted on a tiny panel, just nine by five inches—“small
                  and dainty,” as he considered paintings of these dimensions,
                  and “most portable,” easily tucked by rich Americans into
                  their steamer trunks.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn178" id="page-3-fnref178" class="footnote-ref-anchor">178</a></sup>
                  Whistler briefly considered creating a full-scale version of
                  <em>Purple and Gold</em>, as he had once intended to enlarge
                  the oil sketch known as <em>Tanagra</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-14">cat. no. 14</a>), but his preference for “the dainty” won out in the end.
                  “Would she be more superb,” Whistler wondered “more truly the
                  Builder of Temples—had I painted her what is called
                  life-size?”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn179" id="page-3-fnref179" class="footnote-ref-anchor">179</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Second, the painting presents Phryne as an ordinary artist’s
                  model, stripped of the accoutrements of her legendary wealth
                  and power. Having allowed her drapery to fall to her feet, she
                  stands stark naked before a makeshift backdrop, a deep purple
                  curtain that weighs down the line strung across the studio.
                  Unlike Whistler’s Tanagra models, Phryne strike a formal
                  pose—perhaps owing to the greater exigency of oil painting—but
                  it is not the <em>pudica</em> stance, which would have
                  recalled the Knidian Aphrodite and implied an unwarranted
                  measure of shame. Were it not for the suggestion of a
                  Corinthian terrace on one side of the picture, and the hint of
                  Mediterranean sky at the top, Phryne might be just another
                  Miss Pettigrew posing in the London studio.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Perhaps it was the painting’s air of classical antiquity,
                  combined with its unusually small scale, that caused Luke
                  Ionides, Aleco’s elder brother, to overlook the model’s stark
                  nudity and regard the <em>Phryne</em> as a veritable copy of a
                  Tanagra figurine. “I’ve always said you’re more or less of a
                  plagiarist,” he remarked upon seeing the panel in Whistler’s
                  studio in 1903, certain that the artist had appropriated the
                  figure from a particular (though yet unidentified) statuette
                  in the British Museum. Charmed by the idea, Whistler suggested
                  that they go together to see the alleged prototype so he could
                  judge for himself; but on the appointed afternoon, just as
                  Ionides set off to meet his friend for their excursion, he
                  learned that Whistler had died that very day.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-3-fn180" id="page-3-fnref180" class="footnote-ref-anchor">180</a></sup>

                        butterfly in the cartouche in the oil sketch is exactly
                        like the one that appears for the first time in the
                        dated cartoon, <em>Standing Nude</em>, of 1869.

                        It has been asserted that Alexander C. Ionides did not
                        bequeath anything to his sons in the belief that “dead
                        men’s money” was a curse to male descendants: Dianne

                        This is a misunderstanding founded on a confusion of
                        Ionideses: it was Constantine A. Ionides, Aleco’s elder
                        brother, and not their father, Alexander C. Ionides, who
                        declined to leave money to his sons: see Ionides,

                        This idea owes its origin to Martha Tedeschi, who points
                        out that Whistler might have seen the prints in Paris at
                        the Galerie Durand-Ruel during November and December
                        1891. “In the Studio,” <em>Songs on Stone</em>, 65. That
                        exhibition may have reinforced his interest in the
                        subject, but he had begun his series in June.

                  During the nineteenth century, an accidental archaeological
                  discovery of Hellenistic terracotta figurines in Greece
                  engendered a widespread and long-lived cultural mania. The
                  <a href="#page-https-collections-louvre-fr-en-ark-53355-cl010280695" target="_blank">mass-produced little sculptures</a>
                  unearthed, ranging in height from around four to twelve inches
                  (cat. nos. <a href="#page-catalogue-4">4</a>,
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-10">10</a>), were nicknamed “Tanagras”
                  after the town of Tanagra in rustic Boeotia where local
                  peasants found the first specimens in late 1870. Many
                  figurines preserved their original painted-on colors, and many
                  alluringly depicted women dressed to the nines. Though not
                  dignified by references in Classical literature, these humble
                  miniatures were immediately considered a supreme artistic
                  expression of ancient Greece. Scores of eye-catching figurines
                  were plundered from graves in Tanagra’s ancient cemetery
                  before the Archaeological Service of Athens took over the
                  site. The looted figurines flooded the international art
                  market fanning the flames of Tanagra mania. And, of course,
                  these trendy figurines also captured the imagination of
                  Western artists. The present study examines Tanagra-inspired
                  female depictions in works on paper, paintings, and sculptures
                  from the 1850s to the 1910s by artists active abroad,
                  especially in England and France, and by artists in
                  America.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn1" id="page-4-fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Historically, the nineteenth century was primed to embrace
                  these Greek terracottas. Already in the eighteenth century,
                  the German art historian
                  <a href="#page-https-www-metmuseum-org-art-collection-search-437067" target="_blank">Johann Joachim Winckelmann</a>
                  (1717–1768) had theoretically praised ancient Greek art,
                  initiating a shift from veneration of Classical Graeco-Roman
                  culture toward Hellenism. This orientation was later
                  reinforced by fresh opportunities for a Western audience to
                  see ancient Greek works, like the British Museum’s important
                  display from 1817 of the Elgin Marbles—Classical sculptures
                  taken from the
                  <a href="#page-https-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-elgin-marbles-media-file-elgin-marbles-east-pediment-jpg" target="_blank">Parthenon</a>
                  and elsewhere on the Athenian Acropolis. Moreover, new
                  excavations in Greece enriched the repertory of extant antique
                  marble sculpture with astonishing Hellenistic originals,
                  including the
                  <a href="#page-https-collections-louvre-fr-ark-53355-cl010277627" target="_blank">Venus de Milo</a>
                  in 1820, and the colossal
                  <a href="#page-https-collections-louvre-fr-ark-53355-cl010252531" target="_blank">Nike (Winged Victory) of Samothrace</a>
                  in 1863. And both ancient Greek female images were displayed
                  in Paris’s Louvre Museum, thereby enjoying international
                  renown.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally, the West was well disposed toward modern Greece,
                  which had won sovereignty from the Ottoman Turks in 1832 after
                  a hard-fought war of independence (1821–1829). And like Japan,
                  which the United States opened for trade in 1853, Greece was
                  regarded as a long-inaccessible, exotic land that had recently
                  become tantalizingly available.
                </p>
                <h2>Tanagras Themselves and the Nineteenth Century</h2>
                <p>
                  The pioneering twentieth-century American archaeologist
                  Dorothy Burr Thompson (1900–2001) argued that—despite their
                  nineteenth-century rustic Boeotian associations and
                  nomenclature—Hellenistic terracotta figurines of Tanagra-type,
                  dating from the later fourth to second century BCE, descended
                  from sophisticated cosmopolitan creations produced in Late
                  Classical Athens earlier in the fourth century. And such
                  Athenian-made figurines were exported in antiquity leading to
                  the production of knockoffs and variants in Boeotia and
                  elsewhere in the Mediterranean world.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn2" id="page-4-fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  In the nineteenth century, all terracotta figurines were
                  called Tanagras no matter their findspot.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Hellenistic terracotta figurines were mass produced in
                  coroplasts’ workshops, often employing two-part clay molds (<a href="#page-catalogue-2">cat. no. 2</a>) for front and back, additional molds for features like
                  heads and arms, and some hand-modeled details. A figurine was
                  commonly set upon a slab base, and many had a vent hole on the
                  back to prevent cracking or exploding during firing (<a href="#page-catalogue-4">cat. no. 4</a>
                  and
                  <a href="#page-https-collections-louvre-fr-ark-53355-cl010280671" target="_blank">rear view</a>). The production process afforded creation of multiples as
                  well as variety in poses and types.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn3" id="page-4-fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  Survival of multiples is pertinent for considering a modern
                  artist whose specific Tanagran prototypes are not documented.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These clay figurines were embellished with colors after
                  firing—hand-painted over a white clay-slip—including violet,
                  red, rose, pink, orange, yellow, blue, green, and black, as
                  well as gold leaf.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn4" id="page-4-fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  In modern times, Tanagras preserve evidence not only for the
                  colors of ancient Greek dress but also for the original
                  illusionistic coloring of ancient sculpture.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn5" id="page-4-fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  The last was debated and still somewhat controversial during
                  the nineteenth century since long-known antique marbles,
                  generally preserved without their original surface paint, were
                  often believed to have been left white, and new marble finds
                  featuring well-preserved color were just beginning to
                  emerge.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn6" id="page-4-fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                  Meanwhile, a Tanagra of a draped woman holding a fan acquired
                  by the Louvre Museum in 1876 and dubbed “<em>Dame en bleu</em>” (“Lady in Blue”) (fig. 2.1) was lauded as a well-preserved
                  exemplar of ancient Greek color and gilding.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Like the <em>Dame en bleu</em>, fashionable Tanagran females
                  (e.g., <a href="#page-catalogue-4">cat. no. 4</a>) generally
                  wear a himation, a cloak made of wool or sometimes a lighter
                  fabric, over a chiton, a long linen dress. These Greek
                  garments were woven pieces of cloth that were draped or tied
                  rather than cut and tailored like modern Western clothing,
                  and, significantly, ancient artistic representations emphasize
                  the play of their different layers of cloth over the female
                  body and the resulting complex patterns of folds.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn7" id="page-4-fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  Some
                  <a href="#page-https-www-britishmuseum-org-collection-object-g-1875-1012-9" target="_blank">female figurines</a>
                  also sport a conical straw sunhat (<em>tholia</em>) or carry a
                  tapered fan (of unknown fabric), and some feature both (e.g.,
                  fig. 2.1). The Greek women depicted might be finely accoutered
                  for appearances at public events like religious festivals.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn8" id="page-4-fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  Hellenistic terracotta figurines and fakes also depicted other
                  characters, including male youths, girls, and the goddess
                  Aphrodite (e.g., cat. nos. <a href="#page-catalogue-6">6</a>,
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-10">10</a>,
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-11">11</a>,
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-12">12</a>,
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-13">13</a>), but the nineteenth
                  century’s preference for figurines affording glimpses into the
                  daily life and dress of elegant ancient Greek women may have
                  resulted in greater preservation of those examples.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn9" id="page-4-fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  A unique veiled female figure known as the
                  <em>Titeux Dancer</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-1">cat. no. 1</a>) is critical to this nineteenth-century Tanagra story. A
                  rare extant pre-Hellenistic Athenian figurine of circa 375–350
                  BCE, which is mold made, yet modeled fully in the round,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn10" id="page-4-fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                  this terracotta was named after Philippe Auguste Titeux
                  (1812–1846), a young French architect and archaeologist who
                  discovered it while excavating on the Acropolis in 1846
                  shortly before his untimely death. Its subsequent amazing
                  history was related by Léon Heuzey (1831–1922), a French
                  archaeologist and Louvre Museum curator.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn11" id="page-4-fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                  Titeux’s effects, including the figurine, were transported to
                  Italy and given to his friend the academic sculptor
                  Pierre-Jules Cavelier (1814–1894), then a Rome Prize winner
                  residing at the French Academy in the Villa Medici.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Cavelier brought the figurine back to his Paris studio and
                  made reproductions of it. Though copies were distributed
                  commercially, the original’s location remained unknown to the
                  public. Finally, Heuzey spotted the real figurine on a visit
                  to Cavelier, who then donated it to the Louvre Museum in honor
                  of his deceased friend. In 1891, the
                  <em>Titeux Dancer</em> finally went on display. Heuzey
                  recognized that this dancing female figurine wrapped in a
                  himation may depict a nymph rather than a human being, but the
                  public took little note. This terracotta, although a Late
                  Classical work from Athens discovered decades before the 1870
                  Boeotia find, nonetheless was considered the world’s
                  preeminent “Tanagra” figurine. As such, the
                  <em>Titeux Dancer</em> was an incomparably important source of
                  inspiration for Western artists.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn12" id="page-4-fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In general, during the nineteenth century, eye-opening, trendy
                  Tanagras were exotic goods, readily available for purchase, at
                  first in Greece, and then directly in Europe, England, and
                  America. The hot art market’s supply was augmented by
                  pastiches assembled with ancient fragments and then also by
                  fakes (see, e.g., cat. nos.
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-12">12</a>–<a href="#page-catalogue-13">13</a>), often brightly colored.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn13" id="page-4-fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                  Small in scale and costing no more than a new Parisian salon
                  sculpture,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn14" id="page-4-fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                  both real figurines and unrecognized fakes were avidly
                  collected internationally by private individuals (e.g.,
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-11">cat. no. 11</a>) and by museums,
                  beginning with Paris’s Louvre Museum (e.g., cat. nos.
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-3">3</a>–<a href="#page-catalogue-4">4</a>). Tanagras first became widely known through a display from
                  private collections at the Paris World’s Fair of 1878.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn15" id="page-4-fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                  They were also published with illustrations: 1878, in Reinhard
                  Kekulé’s <em>Griechische Tonfiguren aus Tanagra</em>;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn16" id="page-4-fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  1879, in a monograph by Mary F. Curtis, which appeared in
                  Boston;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn17" id="page-4-fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                  and 1883, in León Heuzey’s Louvre Museum catalogue.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn18" id="page-4-fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>
                  Reinforcing the later Greek focus on female human beings,
                  charming Tanagra figurines struck a chord with some
                  nineteenth-century artists’ burgeoning interest in depicting
                  modern life,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn19" id="page-4-fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                  rather than traditional myth, legend, and history, as
                  championed by the French poet and essayist Charles Baudelaire
                  (1821–1867).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn20" id="page-4-fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                </p>
                <h2>Artists and Tanagras Abroad</h2>
                <h3>Hilaire-Germain-Edgar Degas (1834–1917)</h3>
                <p>
                  The first avant-garde Western artist to pay significant
                  attention to Hellenistic terracotta figurines was the
                  Frenchman Edgar Degas. Since, beyond creating oblique artistic
                  concoctions, Degas unequivocally depicted these figurines, his
                  work provides a firm point of departure. In the 1850s, the
                  young artist copied artworks in Paris’s Louvre Museum, and his
                  preserved sketches reveal unusual choices. Per Theodore Reff,
                  Degas used “Notebook 6,” which is now in the collection of the
                  Bibliothèque Nationale de France, from February to April

                  It contains several sketches depicting ancient Greek
                  sculptural terracottas, including a group of

                  and a very Tanagra-like figurine of a standing draped young
                  woman,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn23" id="page-4-fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Degas noted distinctive features of this female figurine in
                  his sketch: her hairstyle terminating in a hand-modeled double
                  chignon projecting upward from the back of her head; the
                  position of her arms, with one bent before her, the other
                  behind her back, and both wrapped in her cascading mantle;
                  plus her left leg, which is bent at the knee so that the toe
                  of her shod foot peeps out from beneath her draperies.
                  Notably, these terracottas that Degas precociously drew in
                  1856, fourth-century BCE works found at the ancient Greek city
                  of Cyrene (in modern-day Libya), were all acquired by the
                  Louvre Museum in 1850<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn24" id="page-4-fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>—decades before the famous late-1870 find at Tanagra that
                  brought Hellenistic terracotta figurines to the world’s
                  attention.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Parenthetically, another young avant-garde French artist, the
                  Symbolist Odilon Redon (1840–1916) demonstrated early
                  aesthetic interest in Hellenistic terracottas. A
                  <a href="#page-https-collections-louvre-fr-ark-53355-cl020043834" target="_blank">finished drawing</a>
                  he made in the Louvre Museum is after another very
                  Tanagra-like, heavily draped and veiled female terracotta
                  <a href="#page-https-collections-louvre-fr-ark-53355-cl010279742" target="_blank">figurine from Cyrene</a>, likewise acquired by the museum in 1850.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn25" id="page-4-fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                  Since Redon registered to copy at the museum in 1862 and 1864,
                  his drawing must date from those pre-Tanagra years.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn26" id="page-4-fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  This phenomenon of rare Hellenistic figurines known from
                  findspots other than Tanagra eliciting early interest in the
                  genre, including among private collectors, has been dubbed by
                  Violaine Jeammet “<em>des &lt;Tanagras&gt; avant Tanagra</em>.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn27" id="page-4-fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                  And such interest may be ascribed to Degas on yet another
                  occasion. The young artist left Paris in July 1856 to spend
                  several years in Italy where he copied works by Renaissance
                  artists.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn28" id="page-4-fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>
                  During this Italian sojourn, Degas also made
                  <a href="#page-https-www-britishmuseum-org-collection-object-p-1924-0617-33" target="_blank">two studies</a>
                  (see, e.g., fig. 4.1) depicting the <em>Titeux Dancer</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-1">cat. no. 1</a>), which, as we have seen, had been discovered in Athens
                  about ten years earlier. In 1850s Italy, rather than the
                  original figurine (which was then ferreted away in Cavelier’s
                  Paris studio),<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn29" id="page-4-fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>
                  he must have copied a cast, perhaps one housed at the Villa
                  Medici in Rome.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Degas’s sensuous pencil-on-paper sketch with a front view of
                  the <em>Titeux Dancer</em> in the British Museum (fig. 4.1)
                  has not heretofore been considered in published scholarship on
                  the artist. “<em>Etude Tanagra,</em>” inscribed in French on
                  its reverse, could only have been written after the 1870
                  Tanagra find and thus must have been added long after this
                  1850s drawing was made. Degas’s
                  <a href="#page-https-www-sothebys-com-en-auctions-ecatalogue-2014-impressionist-modern-art-day-sale-n09416-lot-341-html" target="_blank">side view</a>, executed in oil on pasteboard mounted on canvas, always
                  remained in the artist’s possession.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn30" id="page-4-fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>
                  His two 1850s studies reveal Degas’s interest in this ancient
                  Greek veiled dancer long before the figurine enjoyed a vaunted
                  position in the later context of Tanagra mania. Significantly,
                  the attention Degas paid to the <em>Titeux Dancer</em> in the
                  1850s—depicting the figurine from two different views—was
                  prophetic of his own later focus on dancers and their
                  movements,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn31" id="page-4-fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>

                  Degas met his close, life-long friend Stanislas-Henri Rouart
                  (1833–1912) when they were teenagers attending the Lycée
                  Louis-le-Grand in Paris in the later 1840s, and, in the 1870s,
                  he served under Rouart during the Franco-Prussian War. Rouart
                  was a wealthy industrialist, a little-known Impressionist
                  painter, and an impressive art collector.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn34" id="page-4-fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>

                  (1863–1929) in the 1870s; then, in the 1880s, as Jean
                  Sutherland Boggs has pointed out, he appears to have planned
                  an oil portrait of Hélène with her mother. This painting was
                  never executed, perhaps because the artist feared it might
                  reveal their problematic relationship.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn35" id="page-4-fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup>

                  and a pastel in Karlsruhe dated 1884 (fig. 4.2) provide
                  evidence for the planned composition. In the sketch, Hélène is
                  shown at center back, standing with hand on hip, totally
                  wrapped in a heavy mantle whose folds crisscross her body: her

                <p>
                  In the Karlsruhe pastel, Hélène has largely been cropped out
                  save for part of her mantled form appearing in the background.
                  The pastel focuses on the seated Mme Rouart, who once again is
                  shown observing rather sadly a Tanagra figurine standing on
                  the table in the foreground. Since, in the nineteenth century,
                  these terracotta figurines were associated with the findspot
                  in Tanagra’s ancient cemetery, they were often regarded as
                  antique funerary figures. Thus Mme&nbsp;Rouart, who seems unwell
                  here and would die in 1886, may be shown contemplating her own
                  mortality.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn38" id="page-4-fnref38" class="footnote-ref-anchor">38</a></sup>
                  The pastel’s draped figurine, though summarily sketched, is
                  shaded in a pale hue suggesting terracotta. It appears to be
                  shown from the back. Édouard Papet identifies this “<em>petit fantôme voile</em>” (“little veiled ghost”) as the <em>Titeux Dancer</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-1">cat. no. 1</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn39" id="page-4-fnref39" class="footnote-ref-anchor">39</a></sup>
                  Save for its head’s leftward tilt, the depicted figurine’s
                  silhouette is indeed comparable to a rear view of the
                  <em>Titeux Dancer</em>, and it likewise does not have a vent
                  hole (see <a href="#page-catalogue-1">cat. no. 1</a> and
                  <a href="#page-https-collections-louvre-fr-ark-53355-cl010261589" target="_blank">rear view</a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Henri Rouart’s brother Alexis (1839–1911) is known to have
                  collected Tanagra figurines; inclusion of a figurine in
                  Degas’s Rouart studies has thus been taken to indicate that
                  Henri might have owned some as well,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn40" id="page-4-fnref40" class="footnote-ref-anchor">40</a></sup>
                  and, therefore, the family’s collecting might have prompted
                  Degas’s association of Hélène’s likeness with these trendy
                  terracottas. Executed in the 1880s—now the height of Tanagra
                  mania—these images stand at the forefront of an important
                  pictorial type representing contemporary women in interior
                  settings contemplating Tanagra figurines (see cat. no. 45).
                  And, if the <em>Titeux Dancer</em> can indeed be identified as
                  his composition’s focal point, for Degas this figurine could
                  well have symbolized this entire genre of terracottas (see
                  figs. 4.1 and 4.2). Regarding Degas’s representation of
                  various artworks in his pictures, Theodore Reff concluded that
                  sometimes a sitter or their family did possess the other work,
                  but most of the time, “the particular work of art seems to
                  have been chosen because of Degas’s own interest in it.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn41" id="page-4-fnref41" class="footnote-ref-anchor">41</a></sup>
                  And Degas’s depiction of the <em>Titeux Dancer</em> in his
                  maturity would indeed have had a long-term personal
                  significance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Remarkably, in a later pastel portrait signed and dated 1886,
                  Degas once again depicts Hélène Rouart posed and attired like
                  a Tanagra figurine (see figs. 4.3 and 4.4), with one arm bent
                  behind her back, wearing a mantle wrapped over her dress.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn42" id="page-4-fnref42" class="footnote-ref-anchor">42</a></sup>
                  In Degas’s earlier 1884 pastel (fig. 4.2), the shawl wrapped
                  around Mme Rouart’s shoulders as well as the drapery of
                  Hélène’s cropped form are shades of blue. In the 1886 pastel,
                  Hélène’s mantle and dress are likewise both colored blue. This
                  pastel portrait’s main title <em>Femme en bleu</em> (<em>Woman in Blue</em>), evokes the Louvre Museum’s renowned Tanagra with
                  well-preserved color known as the <em>Dame en bleu</em> (fig.
                  2.1).

                  In Degas’s 1886 pastel portrait, a bit of white ruffle visible
                  at Hélène’s neck may indicate that the blue dress beneath her
                  mantle is the same one she wears in Degas’s contemporaneous
                  oil portrait in the National Gallery, London, showing her
                  standing in
                  <a href="#page-https-www-nationalgallery-org-uk-paintings-hilaire-germain-edgar-degas-helene-rouart-in-her-fathers-study" target="_blank">Henri Rouart’s study</a>. And Hélène’s father likewise painted her wearing this blue
                  dress trimmed with white ruffles.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn43" id="page-4-fnref43" class="footnote-ref-anchor">43</a></sup>
                  The National Gallery associates Degas’s inspiration for
                  showing Hélène wearing blue in the oil painting with Henri
                  Rouart having owned the generically titled 1874 oil painting
                  <em><a href="#page-https-collections-louvre-fr-ark-53355-cl010066966" target="_blank">Dame en bleu</a></em>
                  (“Lady in Blue”) by Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot (1796–1875),
                  showing a woman, wearing a blue dress and holding a folded
                  fan, standing in the artist’s studio. But Degas’s 1886
                  Tanagran <em>Femme en bleu</em> pastel portrait of Hélène
                  suggests that her wearing blue in his oil portrait of her
                  might likewise betray the influence of Tanagras—notably, of
                  the Louvre Museum’s figurine called
                  <em>Dame en bleu</em> (fig. 2.1), exactly like Corot’s
                  painting. Hélène’s sadness in Degas’s oil painting may be
                  associated with the recent death of her mother; at the same
                  time, Hélène’s serious countenance and avoidance of engaging
                  the viewer’s gaze in both Degas’s 1886 pastel and oil
                  portraits of her might reflect the reserved facial expression
                  and contained bearing of some Tanagra figurines (see figs. 2.1
                  and 4.4). And, while Degas had earlier described Hélène’s red
                  hair and pale complexion as celebrated in Venetian artistic
                  tradition, red hair was also common on Tanagra figurines
                  (e.g., <a href="#page-catalogue-4">cat. nos. 4</a>,

                <p>
                  In Degas’s 1886 <em>Femme en bleu</em> pastel portrait, a
                  rounded form emerging beneath the lower edge of Hélène’s
                  enveloping blue mantle must be a fan held in her hidden left
                  hand—fan-holding is widely attested on Tanagra figurines (see,
                  e.g., fig. 2.1). And Hélène’s pose here appears to have been
                  patterned after a fan-holding figurine of ca. 330–200 BCE
                  (fig. 4.4) in the Louvre Museum, possibly from Tanagra, whose
                  venerable acquisition date is unknown.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn45" id="page-4-fnref45" class="footnote-ref-anchor">45</a></sup>
                  Boggs—probably not conversant with the ancient
                  prototype—misunderstood Helene’s fan in the pastel as a
                  bag.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn46" id="page-4-fnref46" class="footnote-ref-anchor">46</a></sup>
                  But instead of the tapered ancient Greek fan characteristic of
                  Tanagra terracotta figurines, Degas has here substituted a
                  broader rounded model, recalling popular imported Japanese
                  non-folding <em>uchiwa</em> fans. Notably, particularly
                  between 1878—the year of a World’s Fair in which Japan
                  participated—and 1880, and again around 1885, Degas himself
                  decorated salable Japanese-influenced
                  <a href="#page-https-www-metmuseum-org-art-collection-search-436142" target="_blank">art fans</a>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn47" id="page-4-fnref47" class="footnote-ref-anchor">47</a></sup>
                  A couple of Degas’s fans were even owned by Henri Rouart and
                  his brother Alexis.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn48" id="page-4-fnref48" class="footnote-ref-anchor">48</a></sup>
                  Moreover, the fact that the Tanagras’ elegantly accoutered
                  ancient Greek women sported hand fans would have delighted a
                  nineteenth-century audience besotted with both imported
                  Japanese fans and French creations. Documenting the vogue,
                  fashionable Parisian women were frequently depicted holding
                  fans in contemporary art, as in Mary Cassatt’s
                  <em><a href="#page-https-www-nga-gov-collection-art-object-page-46571-html" target="_blank">The Loge</a></em>
                  or Degas’s

                <h3>James McNeill Whistler (1834–1903)</h3>
                <p>
                  Whistler and Degas have commonly been linked on account of
                  their rabid interest in then popular Japanese products, like
                  fans and prints, which both men also collected.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn49" id="page-4-fnref49" class="footnote-ref-anchor">49</a></sup>
                  Turning to ancient terracotta figurines from modern Greece for
                  artistic inspiration constitutes another bond. Neither artist
                  visited Japan or Greece,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn50" id="page-4-fnref50" class="footnote-ref-anchor">50</a></sup>
                  however; their cultural knowledge was based upon commercially
                  available imported goods, objects displayed in private
                  collections, expositions, and museums, plus illustrations and
                  photographs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An American expatriate, Whistler studied art in 1850s Paris,
                  where he first met Degas, but after 1859, he resided in London
                  and traveled between the two cities until relocating to Paris
                  in 1892. Significantly, in London, Whistler was close to the
                  hospitable family of British-Greek shipping merchant and
                  artistic patron Alexander Constantine Ionides (1810–1890),
                  whose youngest son, Whistler’s long-term acquaintance Aleco
                  (Alexander Ionides), collected Hellenistic terracotta
                  figurines like his father.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn51" id="page-4-fnref51" class="footnote-ref-anchor">51</a></sup>
                  With their Greek connections, the Ionides family reputedly
                  purchased stray Hellenistic terracottas found in Boeotia
                  before Tanagra’s discovery, perhaps as early as the 1850s and
                  60s.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn52" id="page-4-fnref52" class="footnote-ref-anchor">52</a></sup>
                  However, such very early acquisitions cannot be documented.
                  And, since a
                  <a href="#page-https-www-gla-ac-uk-collections-details-irn-222113-and-cattype-c-and-gdcevent-hierarchy-item-view" target="_blank">photo album</a>
                  of Aleco’s collection given to Whistler years later contains
                  numerous fakes, which were not produced until after Tanagra,
                  and employs photographic paper not patented until 1879, it
                  must largely reflect later Ionides collecting.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn53" id="page-4-fnref53" class="footnote-ref-anchor">53</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whistler has, nonetheless, been indiscriminately credited with
                  displaying artistic influence from Hellenistic terracotta
                  figurines well before the major late-1870 find at Tanagra.
                  Whistler’s <em>The Six Projects</em>, oil sketches for an
                  unrealized commission, looms large among erroneously cited
                  works.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn54" id="page-4-fnref54" class="footnote-ref-anchor">54</a></sup>
                  In
                  <a href="#page-https-asia-si-edu-explore-art-culture-collections-search-edanmdm-fsg-f1903-177a-b" target="_blank">several sketches</a>, women wear vaguely classicizing garments summarily
                  described with flowing strokes of paint; a few carry a
                  Japanese parasol or fan. Instead of reflecting Tanagra
                  figurines, these generalized images “show groups of female
                  figures in various configurations, reminiscent of the
                  Parthenon frieze but without the consistent orientation of a
                  procession.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn55" id="page-4-fnref55" class="footnote-ref-anchor">55</a></sup>
                  And, in mid-1860s London, artists like Whistler and his new
                  friend, the painter Albert Joseph Moore (1841–1893), were
                  looking at the Parthenon sculptures, freshly reinstalled by
                  the British Museum, rather than the museum’s few Hellenistic
                  terracotta figurines from findspots other than Tanagra.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn56" id="page-4-fnref56" class="footnote-ref-anchor">56</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whistler artworks possibly begun as early as 1869 or 1870 do
                  display an impact of figurines perhaps discovered just before
                  Tanagra,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn57" id="page-4-fnref57" class="footnote-ref-anchor">57</a></sup>
                  which might have been in the Ionides collection. To begin with
                  the clearest, if not necessarily the earliest, example of
                  influence, Whistler’s drypoint
                  <em>The Model Resting (Draped Model)</em> (fig. 4.5), showing
                  a young woman in a contrapposto pose wrapped in a mantle worn
                  over a long dress, has appropriately been compared to
                  Tanagras.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn58" id="page-4-fnref58" class="footnote-ref-anchor">58</a></sup>
                  It mimics an eminently Tanagran way of depicting a Greek
                  himation worn over a chiton and explores the characteristic
                  resulting play of draperies across a female body. At the left,
                  the mantle’s lower end, draped over the model’s hidden right
                  arm, projects away from her body as it hangs downward, thus
                  reflecting a distinctive
                  <a href="#page-https-www-britishmuseum-org-collection-object-g-1874-0305-63" target="_blank">Tanagran motif</a>. The model’s left arm can be discerned beneath the cloth
                  bending up sharply at the elbow so that the hand nearly
                  touches her chin. This arm-toward-chin motif, rather than
                  referencing women in Japanese prints, reflects a
                  <a href="#page-https-www-britishmuseum-org-collection-object-g-1875-1012-9" target="_blank">gesture</a>
                  characteristic of Hellenistic terracotta figurines (see also
                  cat. nos. <a href="#page-catalogue-5">5</a> and
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-8">8</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn59" id="page-4-fnref59" class="footnote-ref-anchor">59</a></sup>
                  The ancient

                  may be employed for the right arm or reversed for the
                  left.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn60" id="page-4-fnref60" class="footnote-ref-anchor">60</a></sup>
                  Aspects of Whistler’s draped model’s pose occur most
                  compellingly on
                  <a href="#page-https-www-britishmuseum-org-collection-object-g-1875-1012-12-a" target="_blank">Tanagra figurines</a>
                  purchased by the British Museum in 1874–75, though these
                  acquisition may postdate the print, and the specific prototype
                  Whistler knew remains undocumented.

                  His design for a fan at the Colby College Museum of Art
                  depicting women at the shore wearing long, flowing garments,
                  with one carrying a parasol (fig. 4.6), emerges from
                  Whistler’s 1868 work on <em>The Six Projects</em>, such as
                  <em><a href="#page-https-asia-si-edu-explore-art-culture-collections-search-edanmdm-fsg-f1903-179a-b" target="_blank">Symphony in Blue and Pink</a></em>. While a decorated fan featuring a parasol may evoke
                  <em>Japonisme</em>, ancient Greek associations dominate this
                  depiction of draped women.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn61" id="page-4-fnref61" class="footnote-ref-anchor">61</a></sup>
                  Significantly, the fan’s most clearly described female figure,
                  dressed in blue and located left of the composition’s center,
                  is unmistakably indebted to Hellenistic terracotta figurines.
                  The Tanagran arm-toward-chin motif (see cat. nos.

                  notably also occurs on this fan’s blue-draped female figure.
                  Moreover, her enveloping blue mantle has been pulled up over
                  the back of her head evoking the veiling of ancient Greek

                  Hellenistic terracotta figurines suddenly attracted Whistler’s
                  attention beginning around 1869–1870, and the artist mined
                  them for eye-catching motifs of pose and drapery. This
                  exciting new font of ancient Greek female imagery—namely,
                  small three-dimensional artworks—afforded a clinically
                  archaeological depiction of layers of ancient garments draped
                  over the female body. In contradistinction to extant battered
                  and/or more formal-looking—if sometimes similarly
                  posed—ancient marble statuary,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn63" id="page-4-fnref63" class="footnote-ref-anchor">63</a></sup>
                  these charming, accessible terracotta female miniatures could
                  be well preserved down to the extremities, enhancing their
                  appeal as prototypes for Whistler’s confections.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn64" id="page-4-fnref64" class="footnote-ref-anchor">64</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  By contrast, the artist’s
                  <a href="#page-https-asia-si-edu-explore-art-culture-collections-search-edanmdm-fsg-f1904-75a" target="_blank">mid-1860s paintings</a>
                  featured Western women wearing Japanese kimonos that often
                  hang loosely like a dressing gown rather than being wrapped
                  around the body and bound by an obi (sash).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn65" id="page-4-fnref65" class="footnote-ref-anchor">65</a></sup>
                  <a href="#page-https-asia-si-edu-explore-art-culture-collections-search-edanmdm-fsg-f1974-62" target="_blank">Japanese prints</a>
                  with their flattened pictorial space did not present clearly
                  how these patterned exotic garments were designed to be worn.
                  Thus Whistler’s kimono-clad women inhabit a realm distinct
                  from these Tanagra-informed, classically draped females.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An intriguing oil sketch by Whistler showing a female figure
                  holding a fan at the Maier Museum of Art in Lynchburg,
                  Virginia (<a href="#page-catalogue-14">cat. no. 14</a>), may be
                  reassessed here. Its draped model looks out at the viewer
                  while posed before a Japanese vase, flowers, and hanging
                  Japanese <em>uchiwa</em> fans. This painting has an intriguing
                  backstory in modern scholarship. In 1960, Andrew McLaren Young
                  linked the Lynchburg oil sketch with a
                  <a href="#page-https-www-gla-ac-uk-collections-details-irn-40215-and-cattype-c-and-referrer-results-and-q-whistler-rose-and-silver" target="_blank">Whistler drawing</a>
                  in Glasgow depicting a similarly dressed and posed female
                  figure likewise holding a fan. He believed that Whistler had
                  inscribed the drawing with the name <em>Tanagra</em>, which he
                  applied to both images. Young considered both works to be
                  inspired by a Tanagra figurine of a
                  <a href="#page-https-www-gla-ac-uk-collections-details-irn-40815-and-cattype-c-and-gdcevent-hierarchy-item-view" target="_blank">veiled woman holding a fan</a>
                  in the Ionides collection photo album;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn66" id="page-4-fnref66" class="footnote-ref-anchor">66</a></sup>
                  his conclusions were generally accepted.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn67" id="page-4-fnref67" class="footnote-ref-anchor">67</a></sup>
                  Subsequently, however, the Glasgow drawing’s
                  <em>Tanagra</em> inscription was reassessed as not dating from
                  Whistler’s lifetime. And the title <em>Tanagra</em> has been
                  dissociated from Whistler’s Lynchburg oil sketch.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whistler’s abovementioned 1860s paintings featuring Western
                  women wearing kimonos in settings filled with East Asian
                  imports exemplify his construct of <em>Japonisme</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn68" id="page-4-fnref68" class="footnote-ref-anchor">68</a></sup>
                  But, despite its Japanese props, ought Whistler’s oil sketch
                  be shifted away from Tanagran inspiration? Does the Lynchburg
                  female figure evoke a kimono-clad woman inspired by a Japanese
                  woodblock print or a woman clad in garments resembling an
                  ancient Greek chiton and himation inspired by a Tanagra
                  terracotta figurine?
                </p>
                <p>
                  First, a Greek contrapposto lies behind the swaying pose of
                  the oil sketch’s woman. A compositionally related crayon
                  drawing by Whistler dated 1869 (fig. 3.1) depicts a
                  classically statuesque nude female figure holding a Japanese
                  fan and standing before a Japanese vase.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn69" id="page-4-fnref69" class="footnote-ref-anchor">69</a></sup>
                  This drawing reveals the influence of his friend Moore’s oil
                  painting
                  <a href="#page-https-commons-wikimedia-org-wiki-file-albert-joseph-moore-a-venus-jpg" target="_blank"><em>A Venus</em></a>, likewise of 1869, which juxtaposes a nude female figure,
                  classical in form,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn70" id="page-4-fnref70" class="footnote-ref-anchor">70</a></sup>
                  Asian pottery, and abundant flowers. Moore’s purposely
                  ahistorical mingling of elements from different times and
                  cultures in the name of aestheticism, or art for art’s sake,
                  was likewise embraced by Whistler.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Second, despite the Japanese props in the Lynchburg oil
                  sketch, its female figure’s dress is demonstrably based on the
                  Greek chiton and himation. In fact, Whistler’s figure bears an
                  astonishing resemblance to a similarly clad female figurine
                  found at Tanagra (fig. 4.7), which counted among the initial
                  specimens to enter the Louvre Museum. This unique example was
                  purchased in 1872 through Olivier Rayet (1847–1887), an
                  archaeologist and historian of ancient art (see
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-52">cat. no. 52</a>), who acquired in
                  Athens the finest newly emerging terracotta figurines from
                  Tanagra during the early 1870s.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn71" id="page-4-fnref71" class="footnote-ref-anchor">71</a></sup>
                  Though this Tanagra does not hold a fan (and the right arm is
                  broken), its potent similarities with Whistler include its
                  bare—not veiled—head looking out toward the viewer; its
                  contrapposto pose, emphasized by the himation shown pulled
                  around the figurine’s bent right knee and calf, and lower
                  body; its himation worn over only one shoulder thus exposing
                  the chiton’s upper portion; and, finally, its himation’s end
                  tossed over and concealing the left arm and hand.
                  (Interestingly, in the sketch, through contrasting color plus
                  pattern, the himation’s bunched upper edge may be interpreted
                  as a scarf or sash.) Whistler’s pale colors and their
                  application have been held to reflect pigment remains on the
                  surface of Greek terracotta figurines—an observation that
                  might well apply to the loosely streaked drapery here.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn72" id="page-4-fnref72" class="footnote-ref-anchor">72</a></sup>
                  If the oil sketch does indeed betray knowledge of this
                  particular Tanagra, newly displayed in the Louvre Museum, work
                  on it would have extended to 1873, when Whistler visited
                  Paris.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn73" id="page-4-fnref73" class="footnote-ref-anchor">73</a></sup>

                <p>
                  The source for Whistler’s Lynchburg oil sketch has usually
                  been identified as a female figurine holding a tapered fan
                  from the Ionides collection photo album.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn74" id="page-4-fnref74" class="footnote-ref-anchor">74</a></sup>
                  Though the Ionides figurine’s himation’s end tossed over an
                  arm is similar, its heavy draping and veiling, downcast head,
                  and introspective nature seem at odds with Whistler’s lithe
                  outward-staring female. Young pointed out that the fan type
                  Whistler depicted is the rounded Japanese <em>uchiwa</em> hand
                  fan rather than the Tanagra figurines’ tapered fan.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn75" id="page-4-fnref75" class="footnote-ref-anchor">75</a></sup>
                  As we have seen, Degas makes a comparable Japanese-for-Greek
                  fan substitution in his 1886 Tanagra-inspired pastel portrait
                  of Hélène Rouart (see figs. 4.3 and 4.4). Whistler commonly
                  <a href="#page-https-www-gla-ac-uk-collections-details-irn-40186-and-cattype-c-and-referrer-results-and-q-whistler-glaha-46014" target="_blank">depicted models</a>—including the nude in his 1869 drawing (fig. 3.1)—holding
                  <em>uchiwa</em> hand fans from his collection. And a
                  photograph of Whistler’s studio at his London residence in
                  Chelsea from 1866–1878 documents these fans hanging
                  decoratively on a wall.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn76" id="page-4-fnref76" class="footnote-ref-anchor">76</a></sup>
                  The Lynchburg oil sketch is, finally, a product of this
                  Whistler studio.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Should the title <em>Tanagra</em> be revived? Whistler’s bold
                  formulation of this painting’s female subject (<a href="#page-catalogue-14">cat. no. 14</a>) is, indeed, ultimately Grecian, springing from a
                  classicizing female nude (fig. 3.1) whose dressed
                  configuration reflects features of a Tanagra figurine (fig.
                  4.7). That said, this artwork undoubtedly exhibits the
                  aesthetic synthesis juxtaposing elements from ancient Greek
                  and Japanese culture dubbed “Greco-Japonisme.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn77" id="page-4-fnref77" class="footnote-ref-anchor">77</a></sup>
                  Taking a cue from Moore’s <em>A Venus</em>, Whistler’s oil
                  sketch might be called <em>A Tanagra</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Later in his career, Whistler displayed an interest in Tanagra
                  figurines once again. In
                  <a href="#page-https-www-gla-ac-uk-collections-details-irn-40534-and-cattype-c-and-referrer-results-and-q-whistler-glaha-46135" target="_blank"><em>The Rose Drapery</em></a>, a watercolor and chalk image from around 1888–1895,
                  Whistler appears to simulate colors associated with originally
                  brightly painted Tanagras.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn78" id="page-4-fnref78" class="footnote-ref-anchor">78</a></sup>
                  <em>A Study in Red</em> (fig. 3.9), a crayon and pastel
                  drawing, circa 1890, related to Whistler’s late lithographs
                  like <em>Draped Model, Dancing</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-25">cat. no. 25</a>), was exhibited in Paris in 1903 as
                  <em>Danseuse athenienne</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn79" id="page-4-fnref79" class="footnote-ref-anchor">79</a></sup>
                  This display designation perhaps suggests that the pastel’s
                  lithe dancing model, with left arm akimbo and right arm
                  covered by her garment, whose clinging draperies sensuously
                  reveal her body, evokes the Athenian
                  <em>Titeux Dancer</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-1">cat. no. 1</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn80" id="page-4-fnref80" class="footnote-ref-anchor">80</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Ionides family proudly showed figurines in the
                  groundbreaking public exhibition of Tanagras at the Paris
                  World’s Fair of 1878. However, in 1894, Aleco Ionides asked
                  Whistler for help selling his collection, and, by this date,
                  he had given the artist the abovementioned photo album.
                  Interestingly, Whistler made a pencil sketch after the
                  photograph of one Tanagra figurine reproduced in the album and
                  mounted it on the opposite page (figs. 3.3 and 3.4).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn81" id="page-4-fnref81" class="footnote-ref-anchor">81</a></sup>
                  His owning the Ionides photo album later in life when Tanagra
                  figurines inspired the artist’s work anew is surely
                  significant.

                <h3>Jean-Léon Gérôme (1824–1904)</h3>
                <p>
                  The allure of ancient Greek terracotta figurines was not
                  limited to avant-garde artists. The French academician
                  Jean-Léon Gérôme was a renowned painter, particularly of
                  Orientalist and historicizing classical themes, who also
                  became a sculptor. He enjoyed his greatest public triumph at
                  age sixty-six in the Salon of 1890 with a personification in
                  marble sculpture of the archaeological site at Tanagra that
                  yielded the terracottas (fig. 4.8).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn82" id="page-4-fnref82" class="footnote-ref-anchor">82</a></sup>
                  His life-sized statue depicts a naked female figure perched on
                  a high, haphazardly excavated earthen mound revealing exposed
                  figurines, including the <em>Titeux Dancer</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-1">cat. no. 1</a>);<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn83" id="page-4-fnref83" class="footnote-ref-anchor">83</a></sup>
                  a pickaxe leans against one side. At the front, ΤΑΝΑΓΡΑ
                  (“Tanagra”), chiseled in Greek capitals, is inscribed on a
                  tablet with handles on its side ends (<em>tabula ansata</em>).
                  Rather than a Tanagra figurine, in its extended left hand,
                  this statue holds a hoop dancer statuette created by Gérôme,
                  which was probably loosely inspired by the
                  <em>Titeux Dancer</em> in conjunction with a then-esteemed
                  figurine (since recognized as fake) depicting a naked female
                  with a hoop.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn84" id="page-4-fnref84" class="footnote-ref-anchor">84</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Gérôme was fascinated with photography, and photographs taken
                  in his studio illuminate both his professional association
                  with and voyeuristic depiction of naked female models. The
                  artist’s 1886 oil painting <em>The End of the Sitting</em>,
                  portraying Gérôme’s still-disrobed model draping with cloths
                  the clay prototype for his nude statue of the Lydian Queen
                  Omphale,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn90" id="page-4-fnref90" class="footnote-ref-anchor">90</a></sup>
                  may be juxtaposed with a series of black-and-white photographs
                  by Louis Bonnard showing, in various views, Gérôme, the nude
                  model, and the clay sculpture in the artist’s studio.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn91" id="page-4-fnref91" class="footnote-ref-anchor">91</a></sup>
                  A separate photograph shows a studio model posing naked for
                  Gérôme’s statue of <em>Tanagra</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn92" id="page-4-fnref92" class="footnote-ref-anchor">92</a></sup>
                  Personifying a Greek archaeological site renowned for its
                  dressed female images with a naked statue was consonant with
                  Gérôme’s voyeuristic artistic preference for disrobed female
                  subjects and his overwhelming reliance upon studio models, as
                  well as with the longstanding Western association of female
                  nudity and the classical world. This combination of potent
                  stimuli resulted in an uncanny modern monument.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Gérôme, moreover, controversially painted his
                  <em>Tanagra</em> statue’s surface with tinted flesh, pink
                  lips, blue eyes, brown nipples, and brown hair. He was heeding
                  the mounting evidence for ancient sculpture’s surface color
                  supplied not only by well-preserved Tanagra terracotta
                  figurines, but also by recent marble finds like the
                  fourth-century BCE
                  <a href="#page-https-en-wikipedia-org-wiki-alexander-sarcophagus" target="_blank">Alexander Sarcophagus</a>
                  discovered in 1887 at Sidon, Lebanon, by a Turkish student of
                  Gérôme, Osman Hamdi Bey (1842–1910).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn93" id="page-4-fnref93" class="footnote-ref-anchor">93</a></sup>
                  And when Gérôme commissioned quarry workers to find marble for
                  <em>Tanagra</em>, he requested a block that would take color
                  well.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn94" id="page-4-fnref94" class="footnote-ref-anchor">94</a></sup>
                  The statue’s color was removed during over-zealous cleaning in
                  the 1950s, save for the polychromy on the hoop dancer.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn95" id="page-4-fnref95" class="footnote-ref-anchor">95</a></sup>
                  Coloring <em>Tanagra</em> figured in Gérôme’s quest to achieve
                  modernity by astonishingly tweaking academic realism, and he
                  painted all his subsequent sculptures down to his final work
                  of 1903, the plaster personifying the Greek city of
                  <a href="#page-https-www-musee-orsay-fr-fr-oeuvres-corinthe-148909" target="_blank">Corinth</a>

                  <em><a href="#page-https-www-daheshmuseum-org-portfolio-jean-leon-geromeworking-in-marble-or-the-artist-sculpting-tanagra" target="_blank">Working in Marble, or The Artist Sculpting Tanagra</a></em>
                  of 1890,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn97" id="page-4-fnref97" class="footnote-ref-anchor">97</a></sup>
                  Gérôme depicts himself—alongside the posing flesh-and-blood
                  female model—toiling on his white plaster original for the
                  marble statue, which would be carved by stone workers. The
                  painting’s visual play—alluding to his intended lifelike
                  coloration of the <em>Tanagra</em> marble statue
                  <em>all’antica</em>—recalls Pygmalion. And, around this time,
                  Gérôme actually painted the classical theme from the ancient
                  Roman poet Ovid’s <em>Metamorphoses</em> of the sculptor
                  Pygmalion, who fell in love with his own statue of Galatea,
                  which was then brought to life by the goddess Venus.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn98" id="page-4-fnref98" class="footnote-ref-anchor">98</a></sup>

                  <em>Working in Marble</em>, as Pygmalion and Galatea

                  In two paintings from 1893,
                  <em>Sculpturae vitam insufflat pictura</em> (“Painting
                  Breathes Life into Sculpture”) (fig. 1.5) and
                  <em>Atelier</em> <em>Tanagra</em> (fig. 1.6), Gérôme imagines
                  the ancient production and sale of Tanagra figurines.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn100" id="page-4-fnref100" class="footnote-ref-anchor">100</a></sup>
                  As Susan Waller observes, Gérôme’s
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    completely feminine cast of characters . . . serves to
                    gender production and consumption of these works. While it
                    is, in fact, unlikely that the original artists were female
                    . . . the gender of the craftswomen in Gérôme’s painting
                    resonates with the French debates in the 1890s about the
                    capacities of women artists. Though they were excluded from
                    the École des Beaux-Arts, women had long been admitted to
                    the École Nationale des Arts Décoratifs, since the
                    decorative arts were widely considered an appropriate field
                    for what were believed to be their distinctly lesser
                    capabilities.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn101" id="page-4-fnref101" class="footnote-ref-anchor">101</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Interestingly, the Greek female artisan in each painting is
                  shown coloring Gérôme’s own then-commercially-available hoop
                  dancer (<a href="#page-catalogue-44">cat. no. 44</a>) rather
                  than an actual Tanagra figurine. Meanwhile, his Tanagra
                  workshops’ Greek female clientele are themselves accoutered to
                  resemble these ancient terracotta figurines down to their
                  sunhats perched at rakish angles. In the nineteenth century,
                  shopping was a rare respectable public freedom allowed women.
                  Already in the 1870s, Edgar Degas had begun depicting
                  milliners in images such as
                  <em><a href="#page-https-www-metmuseum-org-art-collection-search-436126" target="_blank">At the Milliner’s</a></em>
                  and
                  <em><a href="#page-https-www-artic-edu-artworks-14572-the-millinery-shop" target="_blank">The Military Shop</a></em>, showing fashionable women shopping for hats waited on by
                  saleswomen, and also women making hats, then an indispensable
                  fashion accessory sold at the thousand millinery boutiques in
                  nineteenth-century Paris.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn102" id="page-4-fnref102" class="footnote-ref-anchor">102</a></sup>
                  Both artists thus reaffirm that contemporary shopping
                  (especially for artisanal products) was an appropriate subject
                  for modern art. As Sheila Dillon points out, “the renowned
                  French archaeologist Theodore Reinach called the Tanagras ‘the
                  Parisiennes of antiquity,’ thereby equating the figurines with
                  the chic women of modern Paris.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn103" id="page-4-fnref103" class="footnote-ref-anchor">103</a></sup>
                </p>
                <h3>Gustav Klimt (1862–1918)</h3>
                <p>
                  Outside of France, in 1890, the Austrian painter Gustav Klimt
                  was busy working on an early important commission—decorating
                  the grand staircase of Vienna’s recently built
                  Kunsthistorisches Museum. The program, devised by the museum’s
                  head curator, called for depictions of different artistic
                  periods featured in the museum’s collection that incorporated
                  representations of actual works of art. The architectural
                  decoration consisted of oil paintings on canvas affixed to the
                  museum’s walls. Klimt carried out thirteen of the forty-two
                  paintings commissioned from his <em>Künstler-Compagnie</em>,
                  including the two for <em>Ancient Greece</em>,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn104" id="page-4-fnref104" class="footnote-ref-anchor">104</a></sup>
                  which he embodied by means of two distinctly different female
                  figures. One is the armed warrior goddess
                  <em>Pallas Athena</em> depicted in a spandrel here as an
                  imposing, frontal, immortal female figure silhouetted against
                  a halo-like golden round shield, who supports a bronze
                  statuette of a winged victory in the palm of her right hand.
                  Klimt’s hieratic goddess is another nineteenth-century artwork
                  that evokes the lost Athena Parthenos.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn105" id="page-4-fnref105" class="footnote-ref-anchor">105</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sharing the spotlight with <em>Pallas Athena</em>, Klimt’s
                  second female figure personifying the art of ancient Greece
                  is, remarkably, the <em>Girl from Tanagra</em> (fig. 4.9). She
                  is shown as a flesh-and-blood young woman in a dot-rosette
                  patterned dress, with a mantle wrapped around her waist and a
                  wreath in her hand, who is bending forward, perhaps to make a
                  dedication. The Tanagra Girl’s inclusion, decorating an
                  intercolumniation, in this monumental context underscores the
                  lofty artistic significance then ascribed to the recently
                  excavated little Greek terracotta figurines.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn106" id="page-4-fnref106" class="footnote-ref-anchor">106</a></sup>
                  Klimt, like Gérôme, was deeply inspired not merely by
                  discoveries of nineteenth-century Greek archaeology, but
                  especially by their fresh evidence for the surface colors and
                  gilding employed in ancient Greek art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn107" id="page-4-fnref107" class="footnote-ref-anchor">107</a></sup>

                  Klimt’s <em>Girl from Tanagra</em>, while not mimicking
                  specific terracottas in pose or details of dress, has the
                  auburn hair and red lips attested on Tanagra figurines (fig.

                  <a href="#page-catalogue-10">10</a>), enhancing this physical

                  In this painting, Klimt juxtaposes with Tanagra Girl an
                  ancient bronze statuette showing the nude goddess of beauty
                  Aphrodite (Venus) bending over to tie her sandal. This
                  comparison surely alludes to the <em>Girl from Tanagra</em>’s
                  own alluring feminine charms,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn109" id="page-4-fnref109" class="footnote-ref-anchor">109</a></sup>
                  including her provocative, loose long hair and smoky eyes,
                  which make her a progenitor of famous powerful and erotic
                  females from the artist’s later art-nouveau

                <p>
                  The second antiquity depicted here is a Greek vase shown
                  standing on a marble base in the background—an enlarged
                  reflection of an Athenian black-figure amphora of the late
                  sixth-century BCE in the Vatican Museums. Its vase-painting
                  depicts the Greek hero Herakles (Hercules), backed by his
                  patroness the goddess Athena, confronting the multi-headed
                  guard-dog, Kerberos (Cerberus), at the entrance to the
                  Underworld, while the god Hades stands before his palace
                  there, and his wife Persephone, the abducted daughter of
                  Demeter, goddess of earthly fertility, sits inside.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn111" id="page-4-fnref111" class="footnote-ref-anchor">111</a></sup>
                  Herakles captured Kerberos and led the hound back to earth—a
                  labor that symbolized this hero’s gaining immortality. Since
                  then-known Tanagra figurines had generally been found in
                  graves, Klimt’s choice of this Greek vase-painting has been
                  held to indicate that “like Herakles, the Tanagra maidens had
                  returned from the underworld.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn112" id="page-4-fnref112" class="footnote-ref-anchor">112</a></sup>
                  Persephone was another rare mythological character able to
                  return to earth. Significantly, Klimt omits Persephone from
                  the detail of the vase-painting depicted, and his
                  <em>Girl from Tanagra</em> obscures its Herakles. Visually
                  taking the place of these ever-living characters emphasizes
                  Tanagra Girl’s immortal status on Earth amid the international
                  mania for Hellenistic terracotta figurines.

                <h2>Artists and Tanagras in America</h2>
                <h3>Thomas Wilmer Dewing (1851–1938)</h3>
                <p>
                  In late nineteenth-century America, the painter Thomas Wilmer
                  Dewing, influenced by Whistler’s tonalism and
                  <em>Japonisme</em>, became the country’s major practitioner of
                  screen painting.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn113" id="page-4-fnref113" class="footnote-ref-anchor">113</a></sup>
                  In 1894–1895, Dewing traveled abroad to London and Paris, and,
                  for several months, worked alongside Whistler in his London
                  studio. There, Dewing executed the evanescent pastel on light
                  brown paper <em>Figure in Grey and Pink Drapery</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-43">cat. no. 43</a>) depicting an introspective young woman wearing a Greek
                  chiton. With one arm akimbo recalling the
                  <em>Titeux Dancer</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-1">cat. no. 1</a>), the model’s pose has been likened to Tanagra
                  figurines,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn114" id="page-4-fnref114" class="footnote-ref-anchor">114</a></sup>
                  and the pastel’s color should be. A departure from Dewing’s
                  earlier female imagery, might this trendy antique allusion be
                  associated with Whistler’s counsel?
                </p>
                <p>
                  At home, Dewing enjoyed the patronage of two wealthy
                  Detroit-industrialists: Charles Lang Freer (1854–1919), who
                  actively acquired Japanese screens and Whistlers, and Freer’s
                  business partner Frank J. Hecker (1846–1927).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn115" id="page-4-fnref115" class="footnote-ref-anchor">115</a></sup>
                  Both of Dewing’s patrons collected Tanagra figurines in the
                  1890s, and Freer even employed Dewing as an agent to purchase
                  figurines for him in New York City.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn116" id="page-4-fnref116" class="footnote-ref-anchor">116</a></sup>
                  Photographs show Tanagra figurines displayed in Hecker’s
                  French-Renaissance-style Detroit mansion;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn117" id="page-4-fnref117" class="footnote-ref-anchor">117</a></sup>
                  in the Public Room, might a cast of the
                  <em>Titeux Dancer</em> have stood on the mantel? Hecker’s
                  Tanagra collection is considered the impetus behind a pair of
                  tripartite folding screens he commissioned from Dewing in 1898
                  as decoration for his drawing room.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn118" id="page-4-fnref118" class="footnote-ref-anchor">118</a></sup>
                  The sole screen preserved intact, housed in its original
                  Stanford White frame, at the Detroit Institute of Arts, is
                  known as <em>Classical Figures</em>; it depicts three slender
                  female figures in chiton-like dresses peopling an abstracted,
                  misty, verdant landscape.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn119" id="page-4-fnref119" class="footnote-ref-anchor">119</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Dewing’s 1899 tonalist painting commissioned by Freer,
                  <em>The Garland</em> (fig. 4.10), is likewise an abstracted
                  landscape featuring several enigmatic female figures wearing
                  chitons; two figures bear the titular floral garland with
                  their arms extended—one shown in a front view and the other
                  from the back—while the third carries a lute.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn120" id="page-4-fnref120" class="footnote-ref-anchor">120</a></sup>
                  A unique terracotta group from Tanagra (fig. 4.11), which is
                  modeled fully in the round and depicts two comely young women
                  dressed only in chitons and dancing with their arms
                  extended,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn121" id="page-4-fnref121" class="footnote-ref-anchor">121</a></sup>
                  was acquired by the Louvre Museum in 1893. It strikes a chord
                  with Dewing’s lithe, classicizing female figures.
                  <em>The Garland</em> was intended as a gift for another
                  tonalist landscape painter patronized by Freer, Dwight W.
                  Tryon (1849–1925). Interestingly, Tryon happened to see this
                  painting before knowing it would be gifted to him and wrote
                  Freer his reaction: “Gee!! but it’s a corker. . . . One of the
                  things that will live for all time with the Elgin marbles,
                  with Tanagra—with all that is beautiful and uplifting.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn122" id="page-4-fnref122" class="footnote-ref-anchor">122</a></sup>

                <h3>Bessie Potter Vonnoh (1872–1955)</h3>
                <p>
                  At the turn of the twentieth century, a remarkably successful
                  American female sculptor active in Chicago and then in New
                  York, Bessie Potter Vonnoh (fig. 1.19), specialized in
                  depicting women’s daily life primarily in bronze statuettes,
                  inspired by the quotidian female imagery (fig. 3.18) of the
                  American expatriate painter Mary Cassatt (1844–1926) and the
                  trendy ancient Greek terracottas.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn123" id="page-4-fnref123" class="footnote-ref-anchor">123</a></sup>
                  Vonnoh’s distinctive textured and energetic surface handling
                  was influenced by the preeminent modern French sculptor
                  Auguste Rodin (1840–1917), himself an avid antiquities
                  collector, who praised Tanagra figurines highly.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn124" id="page-4-fnref124" class="footnote-ref-anchor">124</a></sup>
                  However, annoyed at critics’ association of her own
                  small-scale works with the ancient terracotta figurines,
                  Vonnoh initially denied knowing about them.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn125" id="page-4-fnref125" class="footnote-ref-anchor">125</a></sup>
                  Yet her now-renowned bronze group
                  <em><a href="#page-https-www-nga-gov-collection-art-object-page-176637-html" target="_blank">Day Dreams</a></em>, which was modeled in 1898 and cast around 1906–1907,
                  depicting two young women napping on a sofa with one reclining
                  in the lap of the other, must immediately have recalled to
                  viewers famous ancient Greek works in the British Museum, not
                  only monumental Classical
                  <a href="#page-https-www-britishmuseum-org-collection-object-g-1816-0610-97" target="_blank">goddesses</a>
                  from the Parthenon’s East Pediment,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn126" id="page-4-fnref126" class="footnote-ref-anchor">126</a></sup>
                  but also a miniature Late Hellenistic
                  <a href="#page-https-www-britishmuseum-org-collection-object-g-1885-0316-1" target="_blank">terracotta group</a>
                  probably from Myrina, acquired in 1885, showing two female
                  figures seated together on a draped couch.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn127" id="page-4-fnref127" class="footnote-ref-anchor">127</a></sup>
                  And Vonnoh’s <em>Day Dreams</em> was first exhibited in a
                  lightly tinted plaster, perhaps associated with the nineteenth
                  century’s awakening to the color of ancient sculpture
                  afforded, in part, by Tanagra figurines.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn128" id="page-4-fnref128" class="footnote-ref-anchor">128</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another early work likewise counts among Vonnoh’s most famous,
                  <em>Girl Dancing</em>, which was modelled in plaster in 1897
                  and cast in bronze around 1899 (<a href="#page-catalogue-46">cat. no. 46</a>). This female figure is not archaeologically antiquizing,
                  however: Believed to be dancing a quadrille, she wears a
                  modified version of a classicizing high-waisted, Federal-era
                  dress with a flowing skirt held out in her hands. Nonetheless,
                  <em>Girl Dancing</em>, who enchantingly moves through the
                  surrounding space, displays a kinship with Tanagra figurines
                  by her very absorption in dance (see cat no. 1; fig.
                  4.11).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn129" id="page-4-fnref129" class="footnote-ref-anchor">129</a></sup>
                  Though Vonnoh’s creations are often around twice the height of
                  Tanagras, the revered ancient figurines’ intimate size raised
                  the esteem for small modern works like hers.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn130" id="page-4-fnref130" class="footnote-ref-anchor">130</a></sup>
                  And in the mid-twentieth century, Thompson associated
                  Hellenistic terracotta figurines with now generally lost
                  ancient prototypes in small bronze statuettes.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn131" id="page-4-fnref131" class="footnote-ref-anchor">131</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  For several years extending into the 1910s, Vonnoh became
                  interested in working with terracotta—an impulse perhaps
                  triggered by Tanagra figurines—and she had a kiln installed in
                  her studio. <em>The Fan</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-47">cat. no. 47</a>), modeled around 1910, is Vonnoh’s best-known preserved
                  terracotta statuette.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn132" id="page-4-fnref132" class="footnote-ref-anchor">132</a></sup>
                  It depicts a young woman with airbrushed facial features
                  holding an open feather fan in her right hand; she wears a
                  long V-necked dress with a cascading skirt that pools around
                  her onto the work’s slab base. <em>The Fan</em> strongly
                  evokes, but does not copy, ancient Tanagra terracotta female
                  figurines, many of whom likewise carry fans (see figs. 2.1 and
                  4.4), though not feather fans.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In her later bronze works, including
                  <em><a href="#page-https-www-nga-gov-collection-art-object-page-176794-html" target="_blank">The Dance</a></em>
                  and
                  <em><a href="#page-https-hoodmuseum-dartmouth-edu-objects-2014-99" target="_blank">The Scarf</a>,</em>
                  both modeled around 1908, as well as
                  <a href="#page-https-www-nga-gov-collection-art-object-page-176661-html" target="_blank"><em>In Grecian Draperies</em></a>, modeled 1912 or 1913 and cast around 1914, Vonnoh did
                  depict contemporary women wearing classically inspired dress
                  loosely based on the ancient chiton.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn133" id="page-4-fnref133" class="footnote-ref-anchor">133</a></sup>
                  And her graceful statuettes bring to mind the Louvre Museum’s
                  unique Tanagra group of chiton-wearing dancing young women
                  (fig. 4.11) that may already have inspired Dewing (fig. 4.10).
                  In an 1896 book, Maurice Emmanuel even endeavored to
                  reconstruct ancient Greek dance using preserved works like the
                  himation-clad <em>Titeux Dancer</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-1">cat. no. 1</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn134" id="page-4-fnref134" class="footnote-ref-anchor">134</a></sup>
                  Modern artistic representations of female figures wearing
                  flowing classicizing dress were especially related to the
                  well-established adoption of such costume internationally in
                  the realm of theater and dance. By the early twentieth
                  century, the American Isadora Duncan (1877–1927) performed
                  abroad and then also in the States wearing loose chiton-like
                  garments often of diaphanous fabric, and she cited Tanagras as
                  a source for her modern self-expression.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn135" id="page-4-fnref135" class="footnote-ref-anchor">135</a></sup>
                  In Parisian haute couture, the fashion house Maison Margaine,
                  founded by Armandine Fresnais-Margaine (1835–1899), had
                  debuted with a “Tanagra” dress in 1889. This streamlined
                  draped Grecian garment, worn with updated underclothes,
                  allowed contemporary women greater freedom of movement.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn136" id="page-4-fnref136" class="footnote-ref-anchor">136</a></sup>
                  By 1912, even a New York Times headline proclaimed that
                  Parisian “Spring Styles will Adopt the Flowing Draperies of
                  the Tanagra Statuettes.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn137" id="page-4-fnref137" class="footnote-ref-anchor">137</a></sup>

                <h3>Thomas Pollock Anshutz (1851–1912)</h3>
                <p>
                  In 1909, the American realist painter Thomas P. Anshutz won
                  the gold medal at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts
                  with <em>The Tanagra</em> (fig. 4.12).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn138" id="page-4-fnref138" class="footnote-ref-anchor">138</a></sup>
                  In this 6.5-foot-tall painting, a smartly dressed woman
                  wearing a towering hat admires a small collectible set atop a
                  large, dark-marble pedestal: It is a terracotta figurine
                  reflecting the Louvre Museum’s famous so-called
                  <em>Tanagra</em>, the eight-inch-high Late Classical Athenian
                  <em>Titeux Dancer</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-1">cat. no. 1</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn139" id="page-4-fnref139" class="footnote-ref-anchor">139</a></sup>
                  The model, Rebecca Harbert Whelen (1877–1950), was Anshutz’s
                  student at the Academy and the daughter of a trustee.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn140" id="page-4-fnref140" class="footnote-ref-anchor">140</a></sup>
                  The artist depicted her frequently between 1905 and 1910,
                  beginning with
                  <em><a href="#page-https-www-pafa-org-museum-collection-item-incense-burner" target="_blank">The Incense Burner</a></em>,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn141" id="page-4-fnref141" class="footnote-ref-anchor">141</a></sup>
                  which portrays Miss Whelen, wearing a resplendent black and
                  gold evening dress, seated on a bench in front of the bronze
                  or brass burner. The concocted settings here and in
                  <em>The Tanagra</em> are formal but indeterminate. These
                  paintings belong to a prominent genre of works depicting
                  women, but symbolically titled after an object in the
                  composition (as in
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-47">cat. no. 47</a>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn142" id="page-4-fnref142" class="footnote-ref-anchor">142</a></sup>
                  In <em>The Tanagra</em>, the Greek figurine is the titular
                  focal point. Here, Rebecca Whelen’s three-quarter-view pose
                  with her left arm behind her back and the pale ecru color of
                  her lovely, but conservative bowed and cinch-waisted day-dress
                  echo the little image of the renowned himation-clad terracotta
                  dancer; Anshutz’s composition likens the modern to the ancient
                  conception of female beauty.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn143" id="page-4-fnref143" class="footnote-ref-anchor">143</a></sup>
                  And his painting thus reinforces a rarefied American ideal of
                  its time.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn144" id="page-4-fnref144" class="footnote-ref-anchor">144</a></sup>

                <h3>Elie Nadelman (1882–1946)</h3>
                <p>
                  Works from the 1910s by the Polish Jewish American sculptor
                  Elie Nadelman were destined to play a role in New York City’s
                  beauty scene. Earlier, while residing amid the bohemian Polish
                  community in Paris, from 1904, Nadelman created avant-garde,
                  simplified and stylized works based on monumental Classical
                  Greek sculpture. According to Barbara Haskell, “this return to
                  classicism for inspiration was particularly appealing to
                  Jewish artists because it bypassed the Renaissance and the
                  Christian subject matter in which its art was steeped.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn145" id="page-4-fnref145" class="footnote-ref-anchor">145</a></sup>
                  Despite suffering from antisemitism in Paris, Nadelman enjoyed
                  great success exhibiting thirteen of his classicizing
                  plasters, including nude statues of women, at Galerie E. Druet
                  in 1909.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn146" id="page-4-fnref146" class="footnote-ref-anchor">146</a></sup>
                  He was then awarded another show in 1911 at London’s William
                  B. Paterson Gallery, where all of Nadelman’s modern
                  <a href="#page-https-allenartcollection-oberlin-edu-objects-10778-classical-head-ctx-9cc468d306f95f53bb564e1f1fd8f0d6d60f79d4-and-idx-1" target="_blank">classical heads</a>
                  were purchased by the cosmetics magnate and art collector
                  Helena Rubenstein (1872–1965),<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn147" id="page-4-fnref147" class="footnote-ref-anchor">147</a></sup>
                  who was likewise an expatriate Polish Jew.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a young woman, Rubenstein went to Australia, where she
                  started her cosmetics business, and then established salons in
                  London and Paris. With the onset of the First World War in
                  1914, Rubenstein left for New York and helped Nadelman move
                  there too. She wanted to open a salon on Fifth Avenue, but
                  Jews were not allowed in the building. Nonetheless, in 1915,
                  Rubenstein set up her first New York City beauty salon nearby
                  at 15 East 49th Street, and it was prominently decorated with
                  Nadelman’s works.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn148" id="page-4-fnref148" class="footnote-ref-anchor">148</a></sup>
                  His sculptural group she had commissioned abroad showing women
                  engaged in grooming and dressing activities (fig. 4.13) was
                  installed in alcoves in the waiting room.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn149" id="page-4-fnref149" class="footnote-ref-anchor">149</a></sup>
                  Nadelman’s group, probably executed circa 1912 and later named
                  <em>The Four Seasons</em>, consists of tall, sinuous, unglazed
                  terracotta female figures, whose flowing draperies display
                  fluted folds. Notably, the Rubenstein terracottas—this
                  artist’s first dressed female images—though not painted,
                  betray a new source of ancient inspiration, Tanagra figurines,
                  which Nadelman said initially intrigued him when he saw the
                  British Museum’s display during his London show.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn150" id="page-4-fnref150" class="footnote-ref-anchor">150</a></sup>
                  To Nadelman, modern sculpture inspired by these charming
                  ancient female figures must have “seemed appropriate for a
                  beauty salon.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn151" id="page-4-fnref151" class="footnote-ref-anchor">151</a></sup>
                  Rubenstein believed Nadelman’s works, which henceforth always
                  decorated her salons, evoked the timeless, classic ideal of
                  female beauty achievable through her regimes and products. She
                  had even changed her first name from Chaja (in Hebrew,
                  <em>Chay-ah</em>, meaning to live) to Helena, thus becoming a
                  namesake of ancient Greece’s most beautiful woman.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn152" id="page-4-fnref152" class="footnote-ref-anchor">152</a></sup>

                <h3>Childe Hassam (1859–1935)</h3>
                <p>
                  In the 1910s, Childe Hassam, the foremost American
                  Impressionist, created his commercially successful
                  <a href="#page-https-www-nga-gov-collection-art-object-page-166494-html" target="_blank">New York Window series</a>, showing women in interiors before windows frequently shown
                  with closed curtains obscuring city views.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn153" id="page-4-fnref153" class="footnote-ref-anchor">153</a></sup>
                  In his Window painting of 1918, entitled
                  <em>Tanagra (The Builders, New York)</em> (<a href="#page-catalogue-45">cat. no. 45</a>), the curtains are parted, revealing men working on a
                  skeletal skyscraper outside. According to Hassam,
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Tanagra—the blonde Aryan girl holding a Tanagra figurine in
                    her hand against the background of New York buildings—one in
                    the process of construction and the Chinese lilys springing
                    up from the bulbs is intended to typefy and symbolize
                    groth—beautiful groth—the groth of a great city hence the
                    sub-title The Builders, New York.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn154" id="page-4-fnref154" class="footnote-ref-anchor">154</a></sup>
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Yet the painting’s young woman does not even look at the
                  dynamic, male, urban realm outside.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn155" id="page-4-fnref155" class="footnote-ref-anchor">155</a></sup>
                  Recalling Anshutz’s earlier <em>The Tanagra</em> (fig. 4.12),
                  the attention of Hassam’s model is likewise entirely focused
                  on an ancient figurine.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn156" id="page-4-fnref156" class="footnote-ref-anchor">156</a></sup>
                  Her Tanagra features a svelte silhouette evoking an Aphrodite
                  (Venus) (see <a href="#page-catalogue-10">cat. no. 10</a>) more
                  than an ancient human female clad in layers of Greek dress.
                  However, this figurine’s coloration in greens and blues, which
                  harmonizes with the picture’s Impressionist color scheme, may
                  also evoke an ideal association of dressed Tanagras with the
                  Louvre Museum’s still beautifully painted
                  <em>Dame en bleu</em> (fig. 2.1).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Wearing a flowing, unstructured housedress perhaps mingling
                  inspiration from Greek and Japanese costume, Hassam’s
                  reflective blonde inhabits a fashionable interior featuring a
                  large Japanese chrysanthemum screen behind her and a highly
                  polished round mahogany table bearing a shallow porcelain bowl
                  of flowers in the foreground. The painting’s assemblage
                  juxtaposing Eastern and Western items is ultimately
                  Whistlerian,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn157" id="page-4-fnref157" class="footnote-ref-anchor">157</a></sup>
                  but rather than the composition of a Japanese print, its
                  restricted space evokes a Manhattan apartment.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn158" id="page-4-fnref158" class="footnote-ref-anchor">158</a></sup>
                  The mahogany table also appears in Hassam’s
                  <em>Maréchal Niel Roses</em> of 1919 at the Smithsonian
                  American Art Museum, where the same blonde model, possibly
                  Kitty Hughes, is seated contemplating that painting’s titular
                  yellow flowers.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn159" id="page-4-fnref159" class="footnote-ref-anchor">159</a></sup>
                  The table was a prop in Hassam’s impressive long-term
                  residence and studio in an artists’ cooperative at 130 West
                  57th Street.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn160" id="page-4-fnref160" class="footnote-ref-anchor">160</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In his later work, Hassam ascribed to an artistic attempt to
                  retain a traditional American ideal, rooted in the late
                  nineteenth century, that involved depicting beautiful, pure,
                  upper-middle-class white Anglo-Saxon Protestant women at home
                  and at leisure, surrounded by tasteful decorations and
                  furnishings—in a realm apart from men. Fueled by social
                  anxiety brought about by massive immigration, a prototype for
                  an “ideal Aryan type” came to be recognized in ancient Greek
                  and Roman art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#page-4-fn161" id="page-4-fnref161" class="footnote-ref-anchor">161</a></sup>
                  While Hassam’s <em>Tanagra</em> painting from the year after
                  women won the right to vote in New York must have been a
                  reassuring concoction for a conservative male audience, one
                  can readily envision its Grecian, figurine-holding, blonde
                  model as having been a customer at Helena Rubenstein’s nearby
                  salon.
                </p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                  Significantly, the modern artworks influenced by these humble
                  but charming ancient Greek terracotta figurines, which were
                  mostly executed by male artists, depict exclusively female
                  imagery. Some works show modern women observing female Tanagra
                  figurines (figs. 4.2 and 4.12;
                  <a href="#page-catalogue-45">cat. no. 45</a>). Others show
                  modern women dressed like female Tanagra figurines (<a href="#page-catalogue-14">cat. no. 14</a>; figs. 4.3, 4.5, and 4.10). A few works represent women in
                  the ancient world dressed like female Tanagra figurines (figs.
                  1.5, 1.6, and 4.9). Gérôme invented a modern monument in naked
                  female form denoting the earth-shattering significance of the
                  1870 archaeological discovery of ancient terracotta figurines
                  at Tanagra, Greece (fig. 4.8). Nadelman created alluring
                  terracotta art figures (fig. 4.13) evoking ancient female
                  Tanagras, destined to decorate a New York beauty salon. These
                  diverse female depictions together demonstrate the enduring
                  cultural dialogue engendered by Tanagra mania both abroad and
                  at home.

                      <p>
                        The following people have aided my scholarship for this
                        essay in various ways: Elizabeth Bartman, Joan R.
                        Mertens, Annie Verbanck-Piérard, Seán Hemingway, Arthur
                        Livenas, J. David Farmer, H. Alan Shapiro, and Eric
                        Silver. In 1997, Stephen R. Edidin invited me to speak
                        at the Dahesh Museum, N.Y., about Gérôme and female
                        nudity; this topic piqued my interest in the influence
                        of Tanagra figurines. A preliminary talk related to the
                        present essay delivered at the 2020 Annual Meeting of
                        the Archaeological Institute of America in Washington,
                        D.C. was followed by expanded versions for the
                        Cosmopolitan Club, N.Y., and the Department of Greek and
                        Roman Art at The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Special
                        access to The Museum’s Onassis Library for Hellenic and
                        Roman Art and Thomas J. Watson Library has facilitated
                        my research. My heartfelt thanks go to the
                        abovementioned individuals and institutions as well as
                        to the curators of <em>Recasting Antiquity</em> for
                        inviting me to participate in this exhibition catalogue
                        and providing scholarly assistance.

                        immigrants outside of Hassam’s milieu.

                        Remarkably, in 1890, Dennis Miller Bunker (1861–1890)
                        depicted his newlywed wife holding and admiring a
                        Tanagra figurine in a painting left unfinished at his
                        untimely death. It was cut down and the figurine part
                        lost; see R. H. Ives Gammell, <em>Dennis Miller</em>

                  <em>binder</em>. The film-forming component of paint, which
                  holds pigments in suspension so that they can be applied to a
                  substrate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>cast</em>. An object made by shaping molten metal or

                <p>
                  <em>chiton</em>. Ancient Greek clothing. A draped garment
                  formed from a single piece of cloth folded around the body,
                  pinned at the shoulders, and tied at the waist. Worn by both
                  men and women.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>Classical period</em>. Historical period in the ancient
                  Mediterranean, conventionally dated between the fall of the
                  Athenian tyranny in 510 BCE and the death of Alexander III,
                  the Great, in 323 BCE.
                </p>
                <p><em>coroplast</em> (artisan), maker of figures in clay.</p>
                <p>
                  <em>edition</em>. The number of impressions printed once the
                  artist has completed and approved the trial proofs. Whistler’s
                  lithographic editions usually comprised between twelve and
                  twenty-five impressions; once he considered the edition
                  complete, he would have the stone erased.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>etching</em>. A kind of print in which lines are incised
                  with a sharp tool into a metal plate covered with an
                  acid-resistant coating, such as wax; when acid is applied, it
                  bites, or etches, the lines into the surface of the plate,
                  which can then be inked and run through the press.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>Hellenistic period</em>. Historical period in the ancient
                  Mediterranean, conventionally dated between the death of
                  Alexander III, the Great in 323 BCE and the Battle of Actium
                  in 31 BCE.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>himation</em>. Ancient Greek clothing. A mantle or wrap
                  worn by men and women.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>impression</em>. A print in ink on paper, approved and
                  often signed by the artist. An impression is essentially a
                  copy of a print, like a copy of a book.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>ink</em>. For printing, an oil-based fluid, as distinct
                  from the water-based liquids used for writing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>keystone</em>. The template for a color lithograph,
                  containing the complete drawing, with registration marks to
                  ensure that subsequent printings for additional colors will be
                  aligned.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>lithograph</em>. A print traditionally made from a
                  lithographic stone on which a drawing has been made with
                  lithographic crayon or tusche.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>lithographic crayon</em>. A crayon composed of pigments
                  mixed with a greasy binder used for drawing on a lithographic
                  stone or transfer paper.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>lithographic stone</em>. The thick, flat slab of limestone
                  on which a drawing is made with lithographic crayon or tusche,
                  or transferred from a drawing on transfer paper.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>lithography</em>. Literally “stone-drawing,” a printmaking
                  process invented in 1798 by Alois Senefelder (1771–1834) based
                  on the principle that grease and water do not mix. The image
                  to be printed, once drawn on or transferred to the
                  lithographic stone, retains ink, whereas the area around it
                  absorbs water and repels ink. The resulting image is the
                  reverse of the original composition; it bears no plate mark,
                  like an etching, although the area that has been flattened in
                  the press can sometimes be detected. A color lithograph, based
                  on a keystone, is printed with inks of different colors, with
                  separate stones used for each additional color.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>mold</em>. A hollow form or matrix used to give shape to a
                  malleable or molten material.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>monogram</em>. A character that interweaves the artist’s
                  initials. In Whistler’s case, the “JMW” took the form of a
                  butterfly in 1869 and continued to evolve throughout his
                  career. It almost always appears in his lithographs, as part
                  of the image, but he often added a butterfly signature in
                  pencil.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>paper</em>. The most common support for prints and
                  drawings. Until the nineteenth century, paper was made from
                  pulverized cotton and linen rags; after wood pulp replaced
                  rags as the most common source of fiber for paper, Whistler
                  continued to prefer cotton and linen papers for his prints,
                  often searching for blank pages in old books.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>pastel</em>. Fabricated chalk: a dry drawing medium made
                  from powdered pigments combined with non-greasy binders, used
                  in the form of finger-length sticks. Whistler favored brown
                  paper as the support for his works in the medium.

                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>poikilia</em>. Ancient Greek term, literally meaning
                  “variation.” Used to describe the visual effect produced by
                  the combination of different colors, materials, and textures,
                  and to express concepts of variety and complexity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>polychromy</em>. The decoration of architecture, both

                  differently colored materials or by the addition of paint.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>press</em>. Lithography requires a special flat-bed

                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>states</em>. The preliminary stages in the printmaking
                  process guiding additional work on the stone or the plate.
                  Impressions that show additions (or subtractions) made to the
                  plate or the stone constitute new states of the print.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>stump</em> (<em>crayon estompe</em>). A short roll of
                  paper or leather used for shading or blending lines. The stump
                  can be suffused with lithographic tusche and used for drawing
                  on transfer paper or directly onto a lithographic stone.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>Tanagra</em>. A town in ancient Boeotia in mainland
                  Greece, which gave its name to the terracotta figurines
                  discovered in its necropolis.
                </p>
                <p>

                  “little roof.” A rectangular face-veil with eye holes, bound
                  around the head with a fillet and folded away from the face
                  back over the crown of the head to form a peaked headdress
                  resembling a gabled roof. Worn by women across Greece between
                  the 4th and 1st centuries BCE and represented almost

                <p>
                  <em>transfer lithograph</em>. Type of lithograph in which the
                  artist draws the image onto a sheet of transfer paper. The
                  method was pervasive in Whistler’s time as it freed artists
                  from the physical limitations of working on a stone; it also
                  provided a closer approximation to the original drawing
                  because the image was not rendered in reverse.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>transfer paper</em>. Specially treated paper designed to
                  receive an artist’s drawing in lithographic crayon and to
                  release, or transfer, the image to the lithographic stone.
                  Whistler often used <em>papier viennois</em>, a grained paper
                  made in Germany or Austria, or <em>papier végétal</em>, a very
                  thin, transparent paper. (See also <em>paper</em>.)
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>tusche</em>. Used in lithography, tusche (the German word
                  for ink) is a black drawing medium containing the same oily
                  materials as a lithographic crayon but used to draw on the
                  lithographic stone with a brush or a pen. (See also
                  <em>lithographic crayon</em>.)
