    <title>"Darlings of Victorian Taste" | Recasting Antiquity</title>

    <meta name="description" content="In the 1930s, during America's worst financial crises, the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt employed photographers to document the plight of everyday folk in the Great Depression in order to push forward with their New Deal programs. Documentary photographers Dorothea Lange and Walker Evans were prolific frontrunners of these efforts and their extraordinary photographs continue to endure today. Their artistic and documentary mastery and historical importance provide key insight into a monumental turning point in American history.">

                <p>
                  Just as the nineteenth century was tiring of the perfect poise
                  of Classical Greek sculpture, the spade of a Boeotian laborer
                  hit upon a new inspiration. Scores of ancient figurines were
                  unearthed from fields surrounding the ancient city of Tanagra,
                  humble objects made of clay, often bearing traces of painted
                  decoration, and rarely more than nine inches tall. The
                  statuettes were ancient, dating to the late fourth and third
                  centuries BCE, but to the Victorians, they were new. âTheir
                  principal charm,â observed the antiquarian Frederic Vors in
                  1879, âconsists in the fact that they are completely different
                  from any other antiques we know.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  Unburdened by inscriptions, allusions, or religious
                  significance (as far as anyone could tell), the figurines
                  seemed to be intended only to delight. Here, at last, were
                  antiquities for everyone, ancient objects that could be
                  appreciated without the benefit of a classical education. âThe
                  remarkable side of the matter is this,â wrote Marcus B. Huish
                  in 1898, âthat no one with instincts for beauty, or interest
                  in antiquity, or in the evolution of art can fail to be at
                  once captivated by these terra-cottas.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the Louvre historian NÃ©guine Mathieux has remarked, âThe
                  figurines appeared during an age that ardently yearned for
                  them.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  <em>Recasting Antiquity: Whistler, Tanagra, &amp; the Female
                    Form</em>
                  explores this episode in the history of taste. The Tanagras,
                  diminutively scaled, delicately tinted, and physically
                  fragile, were instantly adorable to collectors and
                  connoisseurs, exciting both âthe covetousness of museumsâ and
                  âthe sagacity of archaeologists.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  Moreover, they were confidently predicted to benefit the art
                  of their own time: âThese terra cottas,â pronounced Charles de
                  Kay, âare object lessons in art which we cannot afford to be
                  without.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                  Among the leading artists to fall under their spell was James
                  McNeill Whistler (1834â1903) (fig. 1.1), the American
                  expatriate painter, printmaker, and designer best known for
                  the poignant portrait of his aging mother. Between 1887 and
                  1896, at the peak of his professional life, Whistler created
                  images of classically nude and lightly draped figures that
                  reveal his fascination with the ancient figurines (see cat.
                  no. 25). The lithographs in particular, impressions of
                  delicate drawings printed in ink on paper, have come to be
                  called âTanagrasâ for their air of grace and gaiety, the very
                  qualities that made the ancient terracottas such treasured
                  objects in the decades surrounding the turn of the twentieth
                  century.
                </p>
                <h2>The dainty little ladies from Tanagra</h2>
                <p>
                  âTo ninety-nine people out of a hundred,â wrote C. A. Hutton
                  in 1899, âthe interest in any collection of Greek statuettes
                  centres in the dainty little ladies from Tanagra.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                  Although terracotta statuettes were manufactured and
                  distributed throughout the Hellenistic world, the findings at
                  Tanagra around 1870 were so extraordinary and unexpected that
                  the name of the site became indelibly attached to the entire
                  class of female terracotta figurines. Tanagra lies sixty miles
                  north of Athens, not far from Thebes, in the region of Boeotia
                  (fig. 1.2), âa name as readily misspelt,â Huish observed, âas
                  ill-pronouncedâ (Bee-OH-shee-a). According to Reynold Higgins,
                  a modern-day authority on Tanagra terracottas, Boeotia was âa
                  by-word in antiquity for clumsiness and stupidity,â and Huish
                  and his contemporaries could hardly believe that so gauche a
                  place could engender so much charm.
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                  In fact, the format and technology had originated in
                  fourth-century Athens, with figurines exported to Boeotia,
                  where the style was adopted and then perfected by local
                  craftspeople. By the third century BCE, Tanagra productions
                  were disseminated throughout, and even beyond, the Greek
                  world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The figurines that particularly appealed to nineteenth-century
                  collectors were made in the early Hellenistic era, between 330
                  and 200 BCE. Although their subjects range from women and
                  children to actors and old men, the dominant type by far is
                  the standing female figure draped in fabric that falls to her
                  feet and usually enfolds her hands. These female statuettes
                  were âmuch prettierâ and more carefully executed than the
                  others, according to the French archaeologist Olivier Rayet
                  (1847â1887), who supposed they had been assigned to the most
                  skilled of the mold-makers.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  In keeping with the fashion of the day, the typical Tanagra
                  figure wears a large mantle, or cloak, called a
                  <em>himation</em>ââ<em>de rigeur</em> when a Greek lady walked
                  abroad,â one Victorian writer imaginedâover a finely pleated
                  tunic called a <em>chiton</em> (fig. 1.3). In a variation on
                  the earlier, Classical style of draping figures, the thinly
                  woven himation is pulled tightly across the body, showing the
                  folds of the heavier garment underneath.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>

                  The hair of a typical Tanagra figure is intricately styled
                  (fig. 1.4)âone elaborate coiffure has been named by modern art
                  historians for a cantaloupe (see cat. no. 4)âand sometimes
                  covered by a kerchief, or a veil thrown over the head like a
                  hood, or a straw sunhat called a <em>tholia.</em> The figure
                  occasionally holds a heart-shaped fan, or a mirror, or even a
                  child (cat. no. 4), and usually strikes a self-assured pose,
                  âas if attentive to a speaker or an object of not
                  over-exciting interest.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>
                  Her facial expression is generally impassive, which to the
                  Victorians signaled a welcome absence of âdark passionsâ:
                  âSearch through the entire known list of Tanagra ceramics,â
                  wrote Mary Curtis in 1879, âand you will not find a note
                  discordant with the expression of peace, gladness,
                  sportiveness, tempered with a mood of pleased attention, or
                  repose.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>

                  The artisans who created these quiescent figurines were known
                  as <em>coroplasts</em>, the Greek word for âmodelers of
                  girls,â sometimes contemptuously construed as âmakers of
                  dolls.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                  The scorn attaches not only to the domestic subject matter but
                  also to the medium (what Huish called âcommon mother earthâ),
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                  which lacked the prestige of marble or bronze. Nevertheless,
                  nineteenth-century writers generally esteemed the craftsmen as
                  âartists,â or at least âpotters,â and naturally assumed them
                  to be male: âAll these little figures,â writes Wilhelm
                  FrÃ¶hner, a Louvre curator, in 1888, âare of exceptional
                  beauty, created by men of genius.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                  The painter Jean-LÃ©on GÃ©rÃ´me, on the other hand, envisioned
                  the coroplast as a young woman in his
                  <em>Antique Pottery Painter: Sculpturae Vitam insufflat
                    pictura</em>
                  (âPainting breathes life into sculptureâ), an image of a
                  terracotta workshop painted in 1893 (fig. 1.5). GÃ©rÃ´meâs

                  though it might also be the artistâs conception of an ancient
                  artistâs smock, or simply a means of distinguishing her
                  workaday clothing from the brilliantly tinted drapery of the
                  statuettes she makes in multiplicity.

                <p>
                  The production of a Tanagra figurine began with a prototype, a
                  statuette usually modeled by the artist in wax or terracotta.
                  Most Victorian writers presumed that these were modeled from
                  life in the fashion of modern sculpture, as âminiatures of
                  living men and women.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                  âThey are so human in their dainty prettiness,â wrote Hutton,
                  âthat we realize at once that their type of beauty is not the
                  ideal one of the sculptor, but the real one of every-day
                  life.â A writer for the <em>Art Journal</em> went so far as to
                  imagine the Greek artist catching sight on the street of the
                  âelastic step and swaying robesâ of one of the graceful women
                  of Tanagra âwho undoubtedly served as models,â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                  thereby transposing to antiquity the myth of the
                  Pre-Raphaelite âstunner,â a woman of such astonishing beauty
                  that the artist must persuade her to pose or die from
                  disappointment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It remains an open question whether the prototypes were in
                  fact modeled from life. Olivier Rayet could not believe that
                  the Tanagras were mere âreductions of grand sculpture,â when
                  they seemed so well adapted to the terracotta medium and so
                  comfortable in their diminutive proportions,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>
                  yet modern scholarship suggests that they were probably based
                  on life-size statuary, or <em>archetypes,</em> such as the
                  so-called Large Herculaneum Woman (see fig. 2.2), made by
                  leading sculptors. The prototypes, however, were not simply
                  copies in miniature but adaptations, which elevated them âto a
                  high plane of creativity,â as the art historian Malcolm Bell
                  III remarks.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>
                  As a writer for <em>Scribnerâs Magazine</em> acknowledged in
                  1881, the coroplast was âno mere mechanic, no ordinary potter,
                  repeating impressions from the matrix given to him, but an
                  artist, with the soul of a sculptor.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  To create a mold, the prototype would be coated with wet
                  clay.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  Once it dried to a pliable consistency, the clay would be
                  removed to make a concave template, retouched by hand. In one
                  exceptionally fine surviving example (cat. no. 2), we can see
                  how the inner surface has been treated with a modeling tool to
                  emphasize the fine lines of the draperyâs pleated folds, the
                  dominant aesthetic aspect of the figurines. Finished in a
                  kiln, a furnace for firing pottery, the mold became the matrix
                  in which the figurine would be shaped.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To make a figurine, moist clay would be impressed into the
                  mold in a thin, even layer; as it dried, the lining would
                  shrink slightly and release from the mold, whereupon the
                  coroplast would again work by hand to correct blemishes and
                  enhance details. âWhile the clay was soft,â the
                  <em>Art Journal</em> related, âeither with a few bold, flat
                  strokes of some tool the ampler folds were made, or more
                  elaborate effects were brought about by an infinity of lines,
                  which reproduced the foldings and purflings of the
                  <em>himation.</em>â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                  This intervention of the coropolastâs hand, sometimes marked
                  with a fingerprint (see fig. 2.6),<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  brought the object âto a degree of perfection,â as FrÃ¶hner
                  observed, âwhich a merely mechanical process is unable to
                  give.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                  This was a crucial point, for the Victorians needed to
                  distinguish the Tanagras, as mass-produced works of art, from
                  the modern gewgaws daily disgorged by factories in industrial
                  towns in the north of England.

                  The earliest terracottas in Boeotia were produced from a
                  single mold, with a simple slab in back, but around 330 BCE
                  the two-piece mold became customary in Tanagra workshops.
                  Thereafter, most Tanagra terracottas were sculptures in the
                  round.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                  Separate molds were made for parts that would be added to the
                  bodiesâsolid heads, which proved to be almost
                  indestructible;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>
                  accessories like fans, hats, and floral wreaths; and
                  projecting features such as arms and, occasionally, legs or
                  wings. Whether cast from molds or modeled by hand, those parts
                  would be attached to the figurineâs body with the creamy
                  mixture of clay and water called slip, also used to smooth the
                  joins between connecting elements. The hollow figurines would
                  then be settled onto a rectangular plaque, or plinth, and
                  vented in the back to allow moisture to escape and forestall
                  explosions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                  The statuettes emerged from the oven as <em>terracottas</em>,
                  a term that means âbaked clayâ and refers to fired-clay
                  objects modeled by hand or mass-produced with the use of
                  molds.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>

                  Unlike painted Greek vases, their âsister artâ in clay,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>
                  which underwent a complex, three-phase firing process, the
                  figurines were fired only once, at a temperature lower than
                  was required to create an impermeable pot. The potter and the
                  coroplast both relied on the kiln, and may even have shared
                  facilities, but because a terracotta figurine would never be
                  used like a krater or a kylix, it could be simply painted
                  after firing with water-soluble pigments. The figurine was
                  prepared for pigmentation with a coat of whitish clay called
                  kaoliniteâa âbath of whitewash,â in Victorian parlanceâapplied
                  âto overcome the porous nature of the clayâ and provide a
                  smooth ground for color. It could be seen âwherever the colour
                  has disappeared.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>
                  The full *polychromyâ*colors applied to ancient pottery,
                  sculpture, or architectureâwould survive for only a generation
                  or two. Over centuries of burial, the pigments inevitably
                  crumbled or dissolved (see cat. no. 5), and according to
                  nineteenth-century accounts sometimes faded as soon as the
                  objects were exposed to the air.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>
                  Nevertheless, from what remains we can gather, as GÃ©rÃ´me does
                  in <em>The Antique Pottery Painter</em> (see fig. 1.5), how
                  vibrantly, even garishly colored the statuettes must
                  originally have been.
                </p>
                <p>
                  According to FrÃ¶hner, much of the Tanagrasâ popular appeal
                  derived from their âdelicate flesh tint,â a warm roseate shade
                  that, for Victorian connoisseurs, may have recalled the
                  complexion of an English rose. (Oscar Wilde describes a
                  character in <em>An Ideal Husband</em>, 1895, as âreally like
                  a Tanagra statuette,â âa perfect example of the English type
                  of prettiness, the apple-blossom type.â)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup>
                  The typical Tanagra was adorned with blue eyes, rouged cheeks,
                  vermilion lips, black eyebrows, and reddish-brown, or hennaed,
                  hair. Although her shoes were usually hidden beneath her
                  drapery, those that could be seen had red soles, like the
                  Christian Louboutin designer items of our own time: those
                  striking soles are named as an element of the standard Tanagra
                  costume in the <em>Le Costume Historique</em> (1888) (see cat.
                  no. 51), which adds the information that the shoes themselves
                  were yellow, making them resemble, Rayet reflected, the
                  Turkish slippers of the nineteenth century.
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The painters lavished their artistry on the figureâs garments,
                  highlighting their importance as markers of status and
                  sophistication.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>
                  Popular shades were violet and mauve, pigments obtained from
                  the rose-madder plant (see fig. 1.6), although the drapery
                  might be painted almost any color, as Henri Houssay observed
                  in 1876, in âthe whole range of soft shades and broken tones
                  familiar to the painters of Pompeii.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup>
                  We can see this clearly in another of GÃ©rÃ´meâs works,
                  <em>Atelier de Tanagra</em> (âTanagra Workshopâ) (fig. 1.6),
                  whose plummy palette was apparently inspired by that of the
                  figurines. The artist envisions the brilliant violet, scarlet,
                  and turquoise hues of drapery worn by both the figurines and
                  their consumers, while the coroplast, another woman in white,
                  is portrayed touching up a Tanagra figurine with color. Not
                  pictured here is the final, extravagant step for the most
                  precious figurines, the application of gold leaf to details
                  such as <em>fibulae</em> (brooches), earrings, diadems, or the
                  edging of a cloak, gilding designed to catch the light as it
                  glanced across the curves, braids, and folds of the female
                  figure.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Just by tilting the head or turning an arm or adding a hat or
                  an ivy wreath, a coroplast could produce a variety of
                  figurines from a single mold, creating endless variations on a
                  theme. Although each was individually conceived, all possessed
                  âlâair de famille,â as Houssay remarkedâa family resemblance.
                  A second generation would arise when existing mold-made
                  figurines were used as prototypes to yield new molds, thus
                  creating extended families, or âiconographic groups,â in which
                  the figurines might differ in size, due to shrinkage in the
                  kiln, but remain consistent in style, attitude, and
                  accessories (fig. 1.7). As the archaeologist Edmond Pottier
                  famously phrased it, âAll the Tanagra figures are sisters, but
                  few of them are twins.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37" class="footnote-ref-anchor">37</a></sup>

                <h2>A new light on Greek sculpture</h2>
                <p>
                  Frederic Vors assumed, perhaps reflexively, that the Tanagras
                  had been ârather looked down on by the more Ã¦sthetic
                  Athenians,â
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38" class="footnote-ref-anchor">38</a></sup>
                  a condescending attitude that has not altogether disappeared.
                  Over time, the prototypeâs progenyâthe mold-made
                  terracottasâmoved away from the perfection of the archetype.
                  As the aloof manner of the Classical was tempered with the
                  local color of Tanagra, the figurines exhibited their own
                  idiosyncrasies and flair. It was precisely these departures
                  from convention that proved so endearing to Victorian
                  audiences. âThey are summary, sketchy, suggestive,â as
                  <em>Scribnerâs</em> described them, âoften thrown into
                  disproportion by the shrinkage of the kiln, or by a chance
                  pressure of the potterâs hand. For perfection they have no
                  care.â Hutton insisted that their âsketchinessâ was only âthe
                  suppression of the unimportant,â and the
                  <em>Art Journal</em> defended their defects as evidence of
                  what the French called <em>lâart bon-enfant,</em> or
                  good-natured art.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39" class="footnote-ref-anchor">39</a></sup>
                  Particularly in comparison to the severe, marmoreal splendor
                  of the Parthenon sculpture in the British Museum, the
                  terracottas of Tanagra offered agreeable interpretations of
                  antiquity, eliciting not affection rather than awe. âAn
                  entirely new light was thrown on Greek sculpture by the
                  discovery of the Tanagra figurines,â affirmed the American
                  novelist Rupert Hughes in 1896. âIt robbed Hellenic art of its
                  last claim to frigid austerity, and credited it rather with
                  the intimate appeal and the warmth of humanity that were
                  always the acme of its endeavor.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40" class="footnote-ref-anchor">40</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The new light also reflected on the polychromy of the
                  terracotta figurines, which came as a delightful surprise to
                  the nineteenth century. For one thing, it helped resolve a
                  longstanding scholarly debate: because of their colorful
                  aspect, the <em>New York Times</em> asserted in 1890, âthe
                  question of painting statuary has been settled, in so far that
                  we can be sure the ancients colored most, if not all, of their
                  statues.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41" class="footnote-ref-anchor">41</a></sup>
                  Even ancient descriptions of colorful statuary could be
                  dismissed without extant works to back them up, but the
                  recently unearthed figurines could not be ignored, even by the
                  âchromophobes.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn42" id="fnref42" class="footnote-ref-anchor">42</a></sup>
                  The <em>Times</em> critic, as it happens, was writing in
                  reference to GÃ©rÃ´meâs figuration of modern archaeology titled
                  <em>Tanagra</em> (see fig. 4.8), a sculpture that featured
                  several partial representations of terracotta figurines cast
                  in the muted palette of the nineteenth century, as though they
                  had just been pried loose by the archaeologist. Those
                  figurines served GÃ©rÃ´meâs allegory as material evidence
                  supporting the existence of polychromy in ancient marble
                  sculpture, instantiated by the painter in the monumental nude
                  figure.Moreover, as Brigitte Bourgeois observes, the
                  polychromy of Tanagra figurines had a positive aesthetic and
                  commercial effect: âIt contributed to the impression of life
                  emanating from the clay figurines, and encouraged the late
                  nineteenth-century bourgeoisie in their dreams and craving for
                  an âimaginary antiquity.ââ More than any other factor, color
                  allowed the figurines to seem âfamiliar and intimate,â
                  examples, as the <em>Athenaeum</em> said, âof what we should
                  now style popular art.â
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn43" id="fnref43" class="footnote-ref-anchor">43</a></sup>
                  This made it difficult to know how to categorize them. Rayet
                  attempted to force the âpopularâ antiquities into the canon by
                  illustrating them among âthe most remarkable specimens of the
                  antique worldâ in his
                  <em>Monuments de lâArt Antique</em> (cat. no. 52).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn44" id="fnref44" class="footnote-ref-anchor">44</a></sup>
                  They look out of place there, among such icons of antiquity as
                  the Borghese Gladiator and the Crouching Venus, and might
                  better be regarded, as the
                  <em>American Architect and Building News</em> suggested in
                  1879, as âthe <em>genre</em> of classical sculpture.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn45" id="fnref45" class="footnote-ref-anchor">45</a></sup>
                  Although certain antiquaries objected to the use of an
                  expression borrowed from modern art,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn46" id="fnref46" class="footnote-ref-anchor">46</a></sup>
                  âgenreâ was a convenient term for classifying imagery that was
                  unusual for its very ordinariness, âportraits of the people in
                  their daily life, as they passed it,â as Marcus Huish
                  described them, âseated in their houses, or pacing the streets
                  in the bright sunshine.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn47" id="fnref47" class="footnote-ref-anchor">47</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <em>Scribnerâs</em> cast the terracottas in a different
                  metaphorical frame, referring to them as âthe every-day
                  report, the journalism, of Greek life.â
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn48" id="fnref48" class="footnote-ref-anchor">48</a></sup>
                  Some scholars persisted in looking for deities and legendary
                  heroes among the figurines, but it was generally agreed that
                  they were âmerely idealized figures from daily life.â
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn49" id="fnref49" class="footnote-ref-anchor">49</a></sup>
                  In time, the relentless refrain of Tanagras as representations
                  of âordinary lifeâ and âordinary costumeâ became a measure of
                  their monotony, and âwhen a fairly large series is seen
                  together,â they were regarded as âwearisome.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn50" id="fnref50" class="footnote-ref-anchor">50</a></sup>
                  Their interpretive possibilities were quickly depleted: unlike
                  the comparatively arcane imagery on Greek vases, for example,
                  about which a scholar might intone for pages, Tanagras did not
                  require any special erudition to understand or vocabulary to
                  explain. As one critic noted of an 1888 exhibition, âthe very
                  remarkable collection of âTanagraâ figures will appeal to the
                  less âculturedâ amateurs of Greek ceramics.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn51" id="fnref51" class="footnote-ref-anchor">51</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Perhaps as a corollary of their lesser position in the
                  hierarchy of art, many of the scholars who studied the
                  terracottas were female, at least in England. In 1891, when a
                  Miss Sellers gave a lecture on the figurines at the British
                  Museum, the <em>Illustrated London News</em> was moved to
                  remark that âthe learned ladies sent forth from Girton and
                  Newnham,â the womenâs colleges founded at Cambridge in 1869
                  and 1871, had done much to revive interest in classical art.
                  Moreover, it was âincontestableâ that they had helped âto
                  popularize the fruits of recent discoveries among men and
                  women of all classes,â which is to say that they were
                  particularly adept at promoting Tanagras among the
                  uneducated.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn52" id="fnref52" class="footnote-ref-anchor">52</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of the âlearned ladiesâ from Girton was C. A. (Caroline
                  Amy) Hutton, born in New Zealand, who used her initials
                  professionally to avoid being marked as female and thereby
                  regarded as an amateurâdespite her honors degree in Classics
                  and a commendation of her âclassical learning and artistic
                  discriminationâ from the estimable A. S. Murray, Keeper of
                  Greek and Roman Antiquities at the British Museum, in the
                  preface he penned for her
                  <em>Greek Terracotta Statuettes</em> of 1889.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn53" id="fnref53" class="footnote-ref-anchor">53</a></sup>
                  Ten years earlier, Mary F. Curtisâs name had not even been
                  imprinted on the title page of <em>Tanagra Figurines</em>,
                  although âMiss Curtisâ was acknowledged as its author in a
                  book review.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn54" id="fnref54" class="footnote-ref-anchor">54</a></sup>
                  In 1900, Marcus Huish glibly ignored the hard work of his
                  predecessors, excusing his own uncredentialed entry into the
                  field with the assertion that until the publication of his
                  book, the only available resource in English had been a
                  chapter in Murrayâs
                  <em>Handbook of Greek Archaeology</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn55" id="fnref55" class="footnote-ref-anchor">55</a></sup>

                  If even accomplished Victorians could be rendered invisible by
                  their gender, it is little wonder that women in the nineteenth
                  century found pleasure and pride in the Tanagra figurines,
                  images of female autonomy and self-possession. âLife in Greece
                  was lived by men,â announced one writer for
                  <em>Harperâs Bazaar</em>, referring to the silence in
                  classical literature on the daily lives of women, which made
                  it seem as though half the human race had lived for centuries
                  in seclusion. Here, with the Tanagras, were ârepresentations
                  by which we might remake in our fancy the ways of life
                  belonging to women in general.â Indeed, as Hutton reflected,
                  quoting an epigram by Agathias, âWhy do more than half the
                  Tanagra ladies wear hat and shawl if âthey were not allowed to
                  breathe the outer air, and brooding on their own dull
                  thoughts, must stay withinââ?<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn56" id="fnref56" class="footnote-ref-anchor">56</a></sup>
                </p>
                <h2><em>Une joyeuse sociÃ©tÃ©</em></h2>
                <p>
                  In the nineteenth century, the âobject or intentionâ of the
                  Tanagra figurines remained a matter of conjecture. John
                  Pentland Mahaffy, professor of ancient history at Trinity
                  College Dublin, cautioned that it was ânecessary to suspend
                  our judgment, and wait for further and closer investigation,â
                  though he himself was inclined to adopt the theory that the
                  statuettes were made as childrenâs toys rather than fine art,
                  if only because the âminorâ artisans who made them were called
                  dollmakers and âheld in contempt by real sculptors.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn57" id="fnref57" class="footnote-ref-anchor">57</a></sup>
                  Evidence from Athenian tombstones appears to confirm Mahaffyâs
                  theory, though we now generally accept that the figurines
                  possessed âfunctional flexibilityââ that they were used in
                  different ways at different times for different reasons.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn58" id="fnref58" class="footnote-ref-anchor">58</a></sup>
                  With a single object, âthe house was ornamented, the god was
                  honoured, and the dead comforted.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn59" id="fnref59" class="footnote-ref-anchor">59</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The primary purpose of the figurines from Tanagra was probably
                  funerary, however, as the majority were found in the
                  necropolis, or cemetery. Yet unlike lekythoi, vessels made
                  specifically for âsepulchral purposesâ and frequently
                  decorated with funereal themes, the Tanagra terracottas had
                  nothing of the mortuary about them.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn60" id="fnref60" class="footnote-ref-anchor">60</a></sup>
                  âWith what intention,â wondered Rayet in 1875, âwas this
                  multitude of figurines put in the burials?â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn61" id="fnref61" class="footnote-ref-anchor">61</a></sup>
                  Hutton pointed out that âthe use of gay colors and cheerful
                  images in connection with the grave is singularly in
                  contradiction with modern views of death,â and she could only
                  reconcile the incongruity with the view that in ancient
                  Greece, the dead âcheered the dark passage with images of kind
                  and beautiful companions, and with symbols of vigor, of
                  sentiment, of action, and of mirth.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn62" id="fnref62" class="footnote-ref-anchor">62</a></sup>
                  Perhaps because the figurines were regarded with such
                  affection in the nineteenth century, this view of the Tanagras
                  as companions even into death gained currency. Mahaffy thought
                  the terracottas might attest to the human inclination to bury
                  beloved objects with a friend âthat he might not feel lonely
                  in his gaunt and gloomy grave,â and Vors imagined them
                  enlivening the grave, which the Greeks associated with
                  immobility, by providing a âjolly little crowd of little
                  peopleâall full of action and life,â perhaps representing the
                  deceasedâs kith and kin. To Rayet, the gathering was âune
                  Joyeuse sociÃ©tÃ©,â a joyful company made up of graceful women
                  and laughing children.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn63" id="fnref63" class="footnote-ref-anchor">63</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Reluctant to associate Tanagras with the tomb, the Victorians
                  were even more unwilling to relate them to religion. âSome
                  have argued that being found in tombs they must have a
                  religious intention,â the
                  <em>American Architect</em> reported, summarizing the state of
                  the field, âbut the majority have come to reject this theory
                  and accept them rather as intended simply for ornaments.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn64" id="fnref64" class="footnote-ref-anchor">64</a></sup>
                  Archaeological evidence from Tarentum, a site in Italy,
                  contradicts that interpretation of Tanagras as âprofane images
                  which bore no relationship to the sacred,â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn65" id="fnref65" class="footnote-ref-anchor">65</a></sup>
                  and even in the nineteenth century, commentators sought to
                  strike a compromise between the two positions: the terracottas
                  ended up as grave gifts or votive offerings but only after
                  enjoying a secular existence as beloved household objects.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn66" id="fnref66" class="footnote-ref-anchor">66</a></sup>
                  A. S. Murray, in a rare feat of imagination, pictured the
                  figurines âswept together from the walls when some important
                  individual of the house died.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn67" id="fnref67" class="footnote-ref-anchor">67</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Even into the Roman period, the terracottas were intended to

                  âto stand on shelf or in niche if not to be suspended on a
                  peg,â as Charles de Kay supposed: they were âthe familiars of
                  the family without attaining to the dignity of household gods
                  or portraits of ancestors.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn69" id="fnref69" class="footnote-ref-anchor">69</a></sup>
                  Nineteenth-century commentators took delight in regarding them
                  as ancient knickknacks, objets dâart made to crowd curio
                  cabinets and mantelpieces in overdecorated houses (see fig.
                  1.7). Although coming from a period âof far higher artistic
                  attainment,â the terracottas could readily be related to
                  contemporary collectibles made by âthe ordinary Italian or
                  French modeler . . . working in haste for a popular
                  marketââor, from the American point of view, âthose gaudy
                  figurines that are sold in Europe to-day at country
                  fairs.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn70" id="fnref70" class="footnote-ref-anchor">70</a></sup>
                  Predominantly female, the terracottas were most frequently
                  compared to Meissen porcelain figurines, âthe China
                  âshepherdessesâ of modern wareâ (fig. 1.8). Such analogies
                  enhanced the Tanagrasâ popularity as accessible antiquities
                  while undermining their stature and significance as works of
                  art. Murray, whose job was to acquire antiquities for the
                  British Museum, haughtily remarked that âthe
                  <em>koroplathos</em> of Tanagra must have worked for a market
                  where there was less intelligence than what is called taste,
                  and when the wants of private houses were studied rather than
                  the public sense of true beauty.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn71" id="fnref71" class="footnote-ref-anchor">71</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Jean-Leon GÃ©rÃ´me better understood the âwants of private
                  housesâ and the desires of common consumers. His
                  <em>Antique Pottery Painter</em> (see fig. 1.5) reflects a
                  contemporary conception of a coroplastâs studio, with an array
                  of ârealâ and imagined terracottas ranged on the shelves,
                  adjacent to a boutique that would not have looked foreign to
                  nineteenth-century shoppers (although the customers eerily
                  epitomize the figurines they purchase). The cleverness of
                  GÃ©rÃ´meâs conceit becomes apparent when we recognize that the
                  objects lined up on the workbench are anachronisms, images of
                  the artistâs own invention titled <em>Hoop Dancer</em> (cat.
                  no. 44). The figurine derives from the prototype held aloft by
                  GÃ©rÃ´meâs marble <em>Tanagra</em> (see fig. 4.8) and may have
                  been inspired by an unusual (and fraudulent) terracotta of a
                  nude acrobat shown at the 1878 Exposition Universelle (fig.
                  1.9).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn72" id="fnref72" class="footnote-ref-anchor">72</a></sup>
                  Those pictured on the canvas, five awaiting polychromy to
                  order, replicate the artistâs own pastiche of a supposedly
                  ancient archetype, making the painting a riddle of
                  reproductions and originals, forgeries and authentic works of
                  art. <em>The Antique Pottery Painter</em> further functions as
                  a high-art advertisement of the mass-produced figurines, which
                  GÃ©rÃ´me offered in plaster and gilt bronze, commodities that
                  just might be affordable to those for whom an actual Tanagra,
                  to say nothing of an original GÃ©rÃ´me, would have been an
                  impossible luxury.

                <p>
                  With their tasteful swathes of drapery, the Tanagras may have
                  served in their time as three-dimensional fashion plates.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn73" id="fnref73" class="footnote-ref-anchor">73</a></sup>
                  From studying a figurine, one could learn how a Greek woman
                  dressed, âthe shape, colour and fashion of her different
                  garments, and . . . with what infinite variety she arranged a
                  costume which, in itself, is extremely simple, and whose
                  elements never varied.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn74" id="fnref74" class="footnote-ref-anchor">74</a></sup>
                  A color plate in Auguste Racinetâs encyclopedic
                  <em>Le Costume historique</em> illustrates âIndoor and Urban
                  Costume, exactly as worn, here by Tanagran womenâ (cat. no.
                  51)âthe âTanagran womenâ being Tanagra figurines, works of art
                  so true to life that they were considered to provide faithful
                  depictions of âthe actual costume of their period.â Hutton
                  regarded their realism to be âthe secret of their charm.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn75" id="fnref75" class="footnote-ref-anchor">75</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  If only Victorian women would dress as well, sighed the
                  <em>Saturday Review</em> in 1876, if only they, too, wore
                  clothing that âfollowed the lines of the form, instead of
                  distorting themâif graceful drapery were the first object
                  aimed atâthere would no longer be questionings as to long
                  waists or short waists, crinolines, stays or straps.â If
                  examples of such elegant costume were not to be found in the
                  fashion magazines of Paris, then English ladies might avail
                  themselves of a visit to the British Museum, where they could
                  study âthe exquisite draperies of the little Tanagra
                  terracottas, the most beautiful fashion models we shall ever
                  see.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn76" id="fnref76" class="footnote-ref-anchor">76</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was impractical to suppose that modern women could survive
                  in antique drapery, whatever its aesthetic quality, but it was
                  also naÃ¯ve to imagine that the sumptuous clothing of the
                  Tanagra figurines, so consciously and skillfully manipulated,
                  could ever have been their everyday attire. The volume and
                  complexity of the drapery would have made it difficult for
                  women to use their hands for much beyond grasping the edges of
                  the himation, and they would have had to move at a slow,
                  deliberate pace to manage the voluminous folds of material and
                  avoid disturbing the disposition of the dress. âGiven these
                  impracticalities,â Rosemary Barrow observes, âit is unlikely
                  that multiple layers of fine drapery were in everyday
                  use.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn77" id="fnref77" class="footnote-ref-anchor">77</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Contrary, therefore, to the Victorian point of view, the
                  figurines did not portray the ordinary people fitted out in
                  casual clothing for everyday activities. They reflected not
                  reality, but an ideal. Because drapery is neither cut nor
                  tailored, âthe beauty of the chiton and himation lay in the
                  art of positioning them around the body,â as Barrow notes,
                  which implies a certain level of sophistication to wear them
                  well; the figurines, therefore, may have modeled the way a
                  perfectly well-dressed, well-informed Greek woman presented
                  herself in public. Such women would have been members of the
                  social elite, who dressed up in finery for special
                  occasionsâreligious ceremonies or festivals where they would
                  have been expected to display the familyâs wealth
                  civic-mindedness.
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn78" id="fnref78" class="footnote-ref-anchor">78</a></sup>
                  Another of their purposes, then, as Sheila Dillon has argued,
                  may have been to commemorate womenâs participation in
                  religious rituals: collectively, the figurines can be seen to
                  represent âthe world of women on the public stage.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn79" id="fnref79" class="footnote-ref-anchor">79</a></sup>
                  The implicit paradox of the figurinesâimages of women parading
                  their social status with ostentatious clothing, elegant
                  coiffures, and red-soled shoes while maintaining the modest
                  demeanor of well-bred ladiesâwould not have been lost on
                  Victorian women of the upper classes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If âthe dainty little ladies of Tanagraâ were elite, they were
                  nonetheless mortal, lacking the attributes that would identify
                  them as goddesses. Yet there were among the terracottas
                  depictions of the popular goddess Aphrodite, perhaps because
                  she held particular relevance for maidens and married women.
                  As Daniel Graepler notes of the Hellenic worldview, âThe
                  borderline between the human world and the mythical sphere of
                  the gods is often tenuous.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn80" id="fnref80" class="footnote-ref-anchor">80</a></sup>
                  For the Greeks, the archetypical Aphrodite was the Knidia
                  (fig. 1.10), the masterpiece by Praxiteles and the first
                  life-size cult statue of the goddess fully in the nudeâa
                  sculpture that created, all at once, the ideal of female
                  physical beauty.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn81" id="fnref81" class="footnote-ref-anchor">81</a></sup>
                  Terracotta Aphrodites sometimes allude to their illustrious
                  predecessor with their old-fashioned hairstyles, loosely
                  gathered in the back and with a center part; but what makes
                  them immediately recognizableââÃ©vident au premier coup dâÅil,â
                  (âevident at first glanceâ) as Rayet writes in the
                  <em>Gazette des Beaux-Arts</em>âis their partially draped
                  condition.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn82" id="fnref82" class="footnote-ref-anchor">82</a></sup>
                  (Were they to be entirely âundraped,â as Curtis points out,
                  the figurines would be âless steady on their legs.â)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn83" id="fnref83" class="footnote-ref-anchor">83</a></sup>
                  In one common type (cat. no. 10), perhaps adapted from a
                  portrait statue of Phryne, the courtesan of Praxiteles,
                  Aphrodite strikes a pose relaxed enough to hold for an
                  eternity: her left hand rests lightly on her swaying hip, her
                  right on a pedestal, her legs crossed casually underneath her
                  skirt.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn84" id="fnref84" class="footnote-ref-anchor">84</a></sup>
                  If her facial expression looks stern for the goddess of sexual
                  love, the seduction resides in her swaggering pose, with the
                  drapery slipping far enough to bare her breasts but still
                  conceal her modesty.
                </p>

                  Another goddess occasionally found among the Hellenistic
                  terracottas is Nike, the winged Victory. âThey really do
                  appear to fly,â Lucilla Burn remarks, âtheir tall, beautifully
                  feathered wings extended, one leg pushing free of the drapery,
                  which then presses back in windswept folds against the other
                  leg and body.â Because of the projecting wings, the Nike
                  statuettes were especially fragile and may have been intended
                  especially for the grave, perhaps to signify the spiritâs
                  escape from its confines.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn85" id="fnref85" class="footnote-ref-anchor">85</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Nikes became a specialty of the workshops at Myrina, a
                  settlement in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey near the town of
                  Izmir, formerly Smryna) that was probably established by
                  emigrant Boeotians who brought their molds and models with
                  them. Edmond Pottier excavated the site in 1881 and four years
                  later, when the terracottas were exhibited in Paris, they were
                  appreciated as âat once a complement and a contrast to the
                  lovely sepulchral terra-cottas of Tanagra.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn86" id="fnref86" class="footnote-ref-anchor">86</a></sup>
                  Indeed, the Myrina figurines not only supply the gods and
                  heroes absent from the Tanagra population but also manifest a
                  more complex polychromy, with colors layered or artfully
                  juxtaposed to enhance their luminosity (see cat. no. 6).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn87" id="fnref87" class="footnote-ref-anchor">87</a></sup>
                  The Myrina figurines are further distinguished by their
                  remarkable âexpression and energy,â as the
                  <em>Illustrated London News</em> observed (see cat. no. 9), a
                  departure from the âdignified reposeâ of their Tanagra
                  cousins.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn88" id="fnref88" class="footnote-ref-anchor">88</a></sup>

                <h2>In olive woods round Tanagra</h2>
                <p>
                  In one romantic origin story, the ancient artisan makes his
                  Tanagra terracottas of such âdeathless grace and charmâ that
                  they are fated to become the âplaythings to his dead.â Buried
                  by their maker âin the tombs of his elders on the hillsides of
                  BÅotia and elsewhere,â they sleep peacefully, undisturbed for
                  centuries âuntil the pick of the archÃ¦ologist and the
                  excavator on the yellow hillsides by Tanagra wakened them to a
                  new day and brought them forth.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn89" id="fnref89" class="footnote-ref-anchor">89</a></sup>
                  In reality, the unearthing efforts in Boeotia were heedless
                  and rapacious, an unfortunate episode in the history of art
                  and archaeology. The graverobbers so completely destroyed the
                  archaeological contextâthe evidence of the figurinesâ
                  arrangement in the tombsâthat even today, these objects remain
                  in many ways a mystery.

                  Olivier Rayet, who was resident in Athens when the terracottas
                  first turned up, pieced together the story of the early
                  âexcavations.â As a collector himselfâa potential
                  customerâRayet was able to communicate with the tomb robbers
                  and learn from them directly what was happening to the burial
                  grounds around Tanagra; as an archaeologist, he could make
                  sense of the situation and record his conclusions for the
                  readers of the <em>Gazette des Beaux-Arts</em> in 1875 (cat.
                  no. 49).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn90" id="fnref90" class="footnote-ref-anchor">90</a></sup>
                  Graverobbing was not new to the Tanagra region, but it was
                  only in 1870, when some inhabitants of a village three miles
                  below Tanagra called Schimatari (âthe place of statuettesâ)
                  began exploring the earth beneath the vineyards covering a
                  nearby hill, that some curious little objects turned up.
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn91" id="fnref91" class="footnote-ref-anchor">91</a></sup>
                  Word of the finds reached a professional excavator (or
                  graverobber) from Corfu named Yorghos AnyphantÃ¨s, known as
                  Barba-Georghis (Uncle George). By December he had set to work,
                  finding that the ancient graves lined the roads leading out of
                  town, which allowed him to excavate the territory with
                  extraordinary efficiency.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn92" id="fnref92" class="footnote-ref-anchor">92</a></sup>

                  The assiduity of Uncle George inspired scores of laborers from
                  surrounding villages, who helped him ransack the neighborhood.

                  plundering some ten thousand graves between 1872 and 1874.
                  Nearly half the tombs yielded nothing of interest, but some of
                  those in the dry white clay of the hillside contained
                  figurines that were largely intact, with much of their
                  original painted decoration.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn94" id="fnref94" class="footnote-ref-anchor">94</a></sup>
                  As Murray points out, it was âfrom want of supervision at the
                  beginning, and perhaps in defiance of it since,â that the
                  illicitly obtained terracottas poured into private hands and
                  even museum collections, including the Louvre, which made its
                  first accessions in 1872.
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn95" id="fnref95" class="footnote-ref-anchor">95</a></sup>
                  At length, the Greek authorities dispatched troops to curtail
                  the plunder, and the Archaeological Society of Athens
                  appointed a professional to excavate what remained.

                  Greek officials continued to dig at the site until 1879, and
                  by 1881 <em>Scribnerâs</em> could announce that âthe
                  California-discovery day is over now in BÅotia . . . The white
                  lines of dry earth, thrown up from avenues of tombs bordering
                  the antique roads and intersecting the green vineyards and
                  yellow harvests of the modern Albanian agriculturists of
                  Greece, have begun to grow green again.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn96" id="fnref96" class="footnote-ref-anchor">96</a></sup>
                  The tombs had been thoroughly ransacked and the landscape
                  littered with the fragments of smashed vases. Even so, in
                  1882, Oscar Wilde, who was proselytizing the English Aesthetic
                  movement in America, wrote lyrically about âthose beautiful
                  little Greek figures which in olive woods round Tanagra men
                  can still find, with the faint gilding and the fading crimson
                  not yet fled from hair and lips and raiment.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn97" id="fnref97" class="footnote-ref-anchor">97</a></sup>
                  Though out of date, his information came on good authority: J.
                  P. Mahaffy, who had been Wildeâs tutor at Trinity College
                  Dublin, and whom the writer considered his âfirst and best
                  teacher,â the one who had shown him âhow to love Greek
                  things.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn98" id="fnref98" class="footnote-ref-anchor">98</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Published in 1876, Mahaffyâs popular
                  <em>Rambles and Studies in Greece</em> had detailed his first
                  trip, taken only the previous year.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn99" id="fnref99" class="footnote-ref-anchor">99</a></sup>
                  His name, already renowned, had opened doors to Greek
                  collections, and he found the newly excavated Tanagras in the
                  private homes of Athens, âon cupboards, and in cabinets.â
                  Mahaffy was especially struck by their âmarvellous
                  modernnessâ:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    The graceful drapery of the ladies especially was very like
                    modern dress, and they had often on their heads flat round
                    hats, quite similar in design to the gypsy hats much worn
                    among us of late years. But above all, the hair was drawn
                    back from the forehead, not at all in what is considered
                    Greek style, but rather <em>Ã  lâEugÃ©nie,</em> as we used to
                    say when we were young. Many hold in their hands large fans,
                    like those which we make of peacocksâ feathers.
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  For Mahaffy, the figurines attested to the versatility of the
                  Greeks in all matters artistic, âanticipating much of the
                  modern ideals of beauty and elegance.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn100" id="fnref100" class="footnote-ref-anchor">100</a></sup>
                  He was not alone in his tendency to turn this era of ancient
                  history into a reflection of the present day. Edmond Duranty
                  regarded the elegant poses of the figurines to be reminiscent
                  of Parisian coquettes, though the turn of their heads, he
                  believed, possessed a quality that was ineffably English.
                  ThÃ©odore Reinach characterized the typical Tanagra
                  ladyââalways elegant but never affected, always in motion but
                  never in a hurryââas âtruly the Parisienne of antiquity.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn101" id="fnref101" class="footnote-ref-anchor">101</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  For prospective collectors, enchanted with these ancient
                  objects that somehow seemed as good as new, the figurines
                  could not be pulled from the ground fast enough. âEvery
                  museum, every collection, public or private, made a point of
                  securing some of them,â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn102" id="fnref102" class="footnote-ref-anchor">102</a></sup>
                  and as early as 1876, fine-quality figurines were selling for
                  at least Â£40 to Â£60 apieceâsix or seven thousand dollars in
                  todayâs currency. Local laborers had been forbidden from
                  selling their finds âto private fanciers,â but examples could
                  be âsecretly procured for much smaller sums,â according to
                  Mahaffy, âfrom persons who have concealed them for private
                  sale.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn103" id="fnref103" class="footnote-ref-anchor">103</a></sup>
                  Indeed, the black market for Tanagras flourished even before
                  the general public became aware of their existence. The
                  British periodical press first took note of what was happening
                  in Boeotia in June 1874, when the <em>Academy</em> published a
                  belated account of âthe most exquisite terra-cotta statuettesâ
                  emerging from the tombs at Tanagra.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn104" id="fnref104" class="footnote-ref-anchor">104</a></sup>
                  That November it was reported that a small number of âcomely
                  Greek ladiesâ with âuniformly âcarrotyâ locksâ had entered the
                  collections of the British Museum and the Staatliche Museum in
                  Berlin, with further additions to the former in 1876,
                  âremarkable for their almost perfect preservation, and for the
                  delicacy and refinement of the modelling.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn105" id="fnref105" class="footnote-ref-anchor">105</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Yet it was not until the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1878
                  that the figurines were given heightened exposure and a boost
                  in popularity. As Rayet declared in the
                  <em>Gazette des Beaux-Arts,</em> the exhibition âhas won them
                  public favor*.*â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn106" id="fnref106" class="footnote-ref-anchor">106</a></sup>
                  As evidence that they had remained until then virtually
                  unknown,
                  <em>The Illustrated Paris Universal Exhibition</em> describes
                  the terracottas as âcurious,â or exciting attention on account
                  of their novelty, and refers to them as âfigures, or
                  <em>figurines,</em> in clayâ; the italics suggest that the
                  diminutive was still unfamiliarâa specialistâs or foreign term
                  (French, though derived from the Italian <em>figura</em>).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn107" id="fnref107" class="footnote-ref-anchor">107</a></sup>
                  Rayet was impressed that the burst of popular admiration came
                  not only from those of educated taste, âbut also among the
                  Sunday visitors,â the ordinary working class.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn108" id="fnref108" class="footnote-ref-anchor">108</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  After their spectacular debut in Paris, demand for Tanagras
                  rose to a level where not even the black market could keep
                  pace. The <em>Athenaeum</em> reported at the end of 1890 that
                  some ten thousand specimens had been added to museum
                  collections,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn109" id="fnref109" class="footnote-ref-anchor">109</a></sup>
                  a number far exceeding the pool of genuine articles, earlier
                  estimated at about seven thousand. While intact Tanagras were
                  growing scarce, new Tanagras were made every day from
                  fragments âpicked up and stuck together by the natives.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn110" id="fnref110" class="footnote-ref-anchor">110</a></sup>
                  Beyond the figurines cobbled together from bits and pieces
                  were brand new fabrications in the Tanagra fashion, created to
                  appeal to modern taste but wrought to look properly ancient
                  (see cat. nos. 12 and 13). âSo perfect are the imitations,
                  even to breaking a statuette into twenty pieces to add
                  plausibility to it,â reported <em>The Times</em> in 1886,
                  âthat there are said to be only three people in Athens who are
                  competent to determine their genuineness.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn111" id="fnref111" class="footnote-ref-anchor">111</a></sup>

                <p>
                  As early as 1879, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston accepted a
                  cache of twenty-two Tanagras âlately found in the BÅotian
                  tombs,â the gift of Thomas Gold Appleton and the only
                  collection of its kind then in the United States.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn112" id="fnref112" class="footnote-ref-anchor">112</a></sup>
                  Scarcely two decades later, âcultured Boston received a severe
                  shockâ when it was announced that all but three of them were
                  ârank fakes.â

                    the bodies are either wholly modern or made up out of
                    ancient fragments, more or less skillfully pieced together,
                    with the missing parts freely ârestoredâ in plaster. In some
                    cases the original parts are so few, or so battered, that
                    one wonders why the fabricator found it worth his while to

                  Although some forgeries are so skilled that they can be
                  detected only by an expert eye or technical examination,
                  others are surprisingly easy to spot. After the Exposition
                  Universelle, it appears that the customary standing figures,
                  reticent and tightly wrapped, began to seem old-fashioned, and
                  some connoisseurs sought out figurines with more sensational
                  styles and stories. Their desires were satisfied, as if by
                  magic, with elaborate little groups of figures bearing
                  mythological subjectsâthe erotic
                  <em>Leda and the Swan</em> (fig. 1.11), for instance, or the
                  sentimental <em>Aphrodite and Eros</em> (fig. 1.12).

                <p>
                  These wildly popular putative antiquities were âso extravagant
                  in their poses,â as Reynold Higgins observes, âand so
                  unconvincing in their subject-matter that it is surprising
                  that they deceived anybody.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn114" id="fnref114" class="footnote-ref-anchor">114</a></sup>
                  A few Victorian scholars did view the newfound works askance.
                  In 1888, for example, when some questionable figurines went on
                  view at the Burlington Fine Arts Club, the British antiquarian
                  Cecil Torr pointed out that âno terra-cotta of this class has
                  ever been found in any excavation conducted by any government,
                  or society, or responsible person.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn115" id="fnref115" class="footnote-ref-anchor">115</a></sup>
                  The catalogue could only defend their qualities on stylistic
                  grounds, noting that the sculptors in âAsiaâ (Myrina) âbelong
                  to the romantic school,â an explanation that was supposed to
                  account for their more passionate expression. Murray lacked
                  the evidence to rule them out completely but dismissed the
                  newcomers âas foreign in spirit to all that is known of
                  ancient Greek art.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn116" id="fnref116" class="footnote-ref-anchor">116</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Among the most credulous of connoisseurs was Marcus Huish, who
                  had begun to collect Tanagras just before 1890, at the height
                  of the craze: of the thirty or so examples he reproduced in
                  his <em>Greek Terra-Cotta Statuettes</em> of 1900, many drawn
                  from his own and the well-known Ionides collection, at least
                  twenty-two, according to Higgins, âcan be seen at a glance to
                  be forgeries.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn117" id="fnref117" class="footnote-ref-anchor">117</a></sup>
                  It is therefore no surprise that by the turn of the century
                  museums had begun to relegate their holdings to storage in
                  fear that their figurines might also prove to be fakes; for it
                  was only prudent, wrote Higgins in 1962, âto regard all
                  âTanagrasâ as forgeries until they are proved innocent.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn118" id="fnref118" class="footnote-ref-anchor">118</a></sup>

                <p>
                  The <em>Athenaeum</em> prophesied in 1878 that of all the
                  antiquities on display at the Exposition Universelle, the
                  Tanagras would hold âthe most attraction for artistsââand not
                  just for sculptors, as their surfaces possessed a parallel to
                  works in pastel or watercolor: âThe general creamy tone with
                  the faint indications of delicate colour gives an added grace
                  to the exquisite forms.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn119" id="fnref119" class="footnote-ref-anchor">119</a></sup>
                  The following year, the <em>Art Journal</em> expressed the
                  hope that the terracottas would demonstrate, for those
                  Victorian painters prone to grandiloquence, âthat daintiness
                  in Art can be arrived at with no possible loss of force.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn120" id="fnref120" class="footnote-ref-anchor">120</a></sup>
                  In a different era, the terracottas might not have appeared
                  relevant to the development of contemporary art, but
                  understood as decorative objects or drapery studies, they fit
                  the frame of aestheticism, the philosophy of Art for Artâs
                  Sake. Like the modern aestheticist artist, the ancient
                  coroplast âseems to have been guided only by his whim,â as
                  Rayet observed, to have sought only novelty and

                  By the 1890s, the Tanagra figurine had become so closely
                  identified with refined artistic taste that Oscar Wilde
                  bestows one upon Basil Hallward, the artist in <em>The</em>
                  <em>Picture of Dorian Gray</em>, as an emblem of his aesthetic

                  Whistler, on whom Wilde based the artist, did not himself
                  possess a single Tanagra figurine (he could not have afforded
                  one), yet his art naturally aligned with their style of grace
                  and beauty. Whistler was known for the delicacy of his color,
                  the economy of his line, and the daintiness of his touch.
                  Moreover, he consistently opposed the Victorian tendency to
                  measure the worth of a work of art in inches. Among his
                  artistic convictions was that a workâs size and medium were
                  inconsequential: to him, the critic ThÃ©odore Duret explained,
                  the Royal Academy extravaganzas which attracted public praise
                  were little more than âmerchandise,â while little things made
                  from non-prestige materialsâan etching, a paper fan, or
                  âterracottas like those of Tanagraââcould always be âworks of
                  great art.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn123" id="fnref123" class="footnote-ref-anchor">123</a></sup>

                <p>
                  It was late in the 1880s, just as popular appreciation for
                  Tanagras was reaching its height, that Whistler began the
                  series of works on paper which imply his own attraction to the
                  figurines. He never admitted to the influence, nor mentioned
                  the Tanagras in a meaningful way in any of his published works
                  or the eight thousand letters that make up his personal
                  correspondence; nevertheless, as Arthur Hoeber wrote of Bessie
                  Potter Vonnoh, another American artist who succumbed to the
                  Tanagrasâ charm, âThe influence may be traced, even if it be
                  not acknowledged.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn124" id="fnref124" class="footnote-ref-anchor">124</a></sup>
                  Whistlerâs delicate drawings are made from the same two or
                  three professional models, just as the Tanagra figurines
                  derive from a finite set of molds; they also adopt a similar
                  repertoire of lively but casual posesâstanding, seated,
                  leaning, reclining, draping, dancingâas if to modernize the
                  notion of the classical female figure (see cat. nos. 1 and
                  15).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn125" id="fnref125" class="footnote-ref-anchor">125</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Many of the same connoisseurs who pursued Tanagra figurines
                  had a taste for Whistlerâs draped figures. The New York
                  collectors Louisine and Henry O. Havemeyer, for example,
                  bought an impression of the rare color lithograph
                  <em>Draped Figure, Reclining</em> (cat. no. 31) around the
                  same time they purchased a dozen or so purportedly ancient
                  figurines from the renowned Spitzer collection.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn126" id="fnref126" class="footnote-ref-anchor">126</a></sup>
                  Marcus Huish, the self-proclaimed authority on Tanagra
                  figurines, was also the director of the Fine Art Society in
                  London, and in that capacity organized a groundbreaking
                  retrospective of Whistlerâs lithographs in 1895. And the
                  artistâs lifelong friend Alexander A. Ionides, also a patron
                  of Whistlerâs art, assembled one of earliest and most
                  important collections of Tanagra figurines in England. We
                  might, then, expect Whistler to have taken inspiration from
                  the actual terracottas he could have seen in person, either in
                  the collections of his friends or the galleries of the Louvre
                  or the British Museum. Yet we should not overlook the probable
                  importance of the illustrations of Tanagra figurines
                  proliferating in contemporary books and periodicals. It is
                  surely significant that Whistlerâs only extant drawing of a
                  Tanagra (fig. 1.14)âthe mere adumbration of a figurineâwas
                  based not on an actual terracotta, but on a photograph of one
                  (fig. 1.15), an image of an object already transposed into two
                  dimensions and translated into black and white.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although that sketch was never intended for public viewâit
                  remains hidden away on the cardboard backing of another
                  photograph in a private albumâWhistlerâs improvisatory
                  drawings on the Tanagra theme were meant to be multiplied,
                  primarily in the form of lithographs. To understand why he
                  chose that medium instead of etching, in which he was already
                  well established, we might compare two illustrations of
                  Tanagra figurines made by different printmaking processes.
                  Both were published in a single volume of the
                  <em>Gazette archÃ©ologique:</em> one is a steel engraving (an
                  <em>intaglio,</em> or incised design on a metal plate, like an
                  etching) of a seated Tanagra figurine (fig.1.16); the second
                  (fig. 1.17), of a pair of standing figures, is a lithograph
                  made by a young student of GÃ©rÃ´me who styled himself P-A-J
                  Dagnan, but later became known as the painter Pascal
                  Dagnan-Bouveret (1852â1929).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn127" id="fnref127" class="footnote-ref-anchor">127</a></sup>
                  The engraving appears linear and hard-edged, conveying the
                  âaustere severityâ and stony permanence associated with the
                  High Classical style: nothing about the picture suggests that
                  the figure is small in scale or made from clay. Dagnanâs
                  lithograph, on the other hand, retains the softness of his
                  original sketch, probably made with a greasy lithographic
                  crayon on a smooth limestone slab. Even in black and white,
                  the medium renders a sensitive translation of the tiny,
                  fragile terracotta figurines, lightly dusted with ephemeral
                  pigments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Beyond its use for illustrations, lithography was put to work
                  in the nineteenth century in the profitable business of
                  reproducing paintings for a popular market. In that respect,
                  the medium finds a parallel in the Tanagra terracottas.
                  âSuppose we regard them as popular editions of works by
                  masters,â wrote Charles de Kay, âsuited, by the material in
                  which they are fashioned and the methods used to fashion them,
                  to the slender purses of the people.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn128" id="fnref128" class="footnote-ref-anchor">128</a></sup>
                  Whistler may have recognized that the Tanagras, as works of
                  art, transcended their commercial aspect, just as he saw the
                  potential of lithography as a means of original artistic
                  expression. In his hands, one journalist remarked in 1895,
                  âthe despised art of the stone long in commercial bondage is
                  again set free for the artistâs service.â
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn129" id="fnref129" class="footnote-ref-anchor">129</a></sup>
                  Moreover, his meticulous attention to details of paper and
                  printing transformed the commonplace âlithoâ into a precious
                  object.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nevertheless, Whistler failed to achieve the success he
                  expected when adopting a medium more accessible and
                  inexpensive than oil or etching. In the popular sphere, the
                  âdaintinessâ of his style worked against him: his subject
                  matter, distilled to its essence, appeared too slight, the
                  drawing too cursory, to justify the cost even of a
                  lithographic print.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn130" id="fnref130" class="footnote-ref-anchor">130</a></sup>
                  More consequentially, perhaps, Whistlerâs Tanagras challenged
                  the norms of Victorian propriety. In a crucial departure from
                  the modestly draped Tanagra figurines, his Tanagra-esque
                  figures are mostly, and sometimes entirely, nude (see cat.
                  34). He did away with opaque drapery as a means of liberating
                  figures he intended to embody the unencumbered spirit of art.
                  What he discovered was that, especially in America, âa nude
                  figure suggests at once the absence of clothesâand general
                  improprietyâonly!â His New York dealer informed him that
                  <em>Cameo, No. 1</em> (cat. no. 39), for example, could not be
                  sold at the price Whistler set âbecause of the thinness of the
                  drapery.â Indeed, the modelâs bare leg is fully exposed as she
                  sits on the side of the bed to bend and kiss a sleeping
                  childâan innocent image if ever there was one, but
                  objectionable to a nation, Whistler observed, âthat requires
                  the legs of the piano to be draped.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn131" id="fnref131" class="footnote-ref-anchor">131</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although Whistlerâs Tanagras, primarily executed as
                  lithographs and pastels, imply an interest confined to works
                  on paper, an episode in the early 1880s suggests that he may
                  have explored the medium of small-scale sculpture, if only in
                  terms of polychromy. The evidence is a photograph taken in
                  Whistlerâs London studio in 1881 (fig. 1.18), which shows a
                  modern statuette of a female figure standing no more than
                  eight inches high, though elevated to become part of the
                  circle of friends: the gathering includes Whistler and
                  Frederick Lawless, the Irish sculptor who set up the
                  photograph; Frank Miles, an English society painter who lived
                  across the street; and the two talented sons of the American
                  neoclassical sculptor William Wetmore StoryâJulian, a painter,
                  and Waldo, a sculptor, who happened to be visiting London that
                  year from Rome.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn132" id="fnref132" class="footnote-ref-anchor">132</a></sup>
                  Made at the time of the terracotta craze and similar in stance
                  and size to a Tanagra statuette, the figurine seems to have
                  been only one in a series of plaster statuettes striking
                  haughty poses and wearing stylish clothingââcharming little
                  swaggerers,â as Whistler referred to them in a letter,
                  âlooking prettier than ever.â
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn133" id="fnref133" class="footnote-ref-anchor">133</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  When the figurines were eventually packed up and sent home to
                  Waldo Story, Whistler referred to them fondly as âtokens of
                  our work in the studio together,â which suggests a degree of
                  collaboration.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn134" id="fnref134" class="footnote-ref-anchor">134</a></sup>
                  It is reasonable to assume that Story modeled the figure
                  (shaped it in plaster) and Whistler dressed it with paint;
                  Lawless recollected twenty years later that Whistler had made
                  the figurine himself, though no one else could remember the
                  artist ever trying his hand at sculpture.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn135" id="fnref135" class="footnote-ref-anchor">135</a></sup>
                  Margaret F. MacDonald also gives Whistler full credit, citing
                  his convincingly comparable, contemporary watercolors of
                  fashionable young women in âswaggeringâ attitudes,
                  particularly
                  <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/13245" target="_blank"><em>Lady in Gray</em></a>, of a model who holds a large, picture hat in a similar
                  position to the figure in the photograph.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn136" id="fnref136" class="footnote-ref-anchor">136</a></sup>
                  The physical evidence that might have settled the question was
                  lost when the âlovely figurines,â though carefully packed,
                  arrived in Rome in pieces.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn137" id="fnref137" class="footnote-ref-anchor">137</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In a way that Whistlerâs works on paper do not, Storyâs little
                  figure looks quaint, almost certainly because of her
                  contemporary dress. In his Tanagra lithographs and pastels,
                  Whistler was able to effectively avoid the trammels of
                  Victorian fashion, which proved particularly exasperating to
                  sculptors of his time. âThe freer garb of classic maidenhood
                  presented easier and more inspiring problems to the ancient
                  masters of clay and stone,â wrote Hoeber in 1897, who dearly
                  hoped that âthe hideous fashionable dress of the present may
                  by proper treatment be softened and mitigated.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn138" id="fnref138" class="footnote-ref-anchor">138</a></sup>
                  Bessie Potter Vonnoh, looking back on the last decades of the
                  nineteenth century, recalled the difficulty of trying to
                  accommodate the âatrocious fashions of the dayâââballoon
                  sleeves, pinched waists, full skirts, funny little hatsââ
                  especially on the small scale in which she worked. Although
                  she sometimes depicted modern women in the costume of an
                  earlier, more graceful era, as in the bronze
                  <em>Girl Dancing</em> (cat. no. 46), Vonnoh rarely resorted to
                  classical drapery. Greek sculpture held little appeal for her.
                  What she wanted, she said, was âto catch the joy and swing of
                  modern American life, using the methods of the Greeks but not
                  their subject-matter.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn139" id="fnref139" class="footnote-ref-anchor">139</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tanagra figurines were gaining popularity in the United States
                  just as Vonnoh was coming into her own as a sculptor. They
                  obviously provided a congenial model for her work, yet she
                  initially denied their influence because, according to Julie
                  Aronson, âthey subverted her self-image as a pioneering
                  recorder of modern life in a modern idiom.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn140" id="fnref140" class="footnote-ref-anchor">140</a></sup>
                  Eventually, Vonnoh acknowledged her own efforts to capture
                  what one contemporary journalist called âthe spirit of the
                  Tanagra statuette, translated into the idiom of the Twentieth
                  Century.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn141" id="fnref141" class="footnote-ref-anchor">141</a></sup>
                  Although her statuettes were somewhat larger than the average
                  Tanagra figurine and their facial features more defined, âthe
                  fundamental idea and the manner of treatment,â noted the
                  critic Helen Zimmern, âare <em>mutatis mutandis</em> the
                  sameâ: there were differences between them, in other words,
                  but only because certain aspects had to be altered.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn142" id="fnref142" class="footnote-ref-anchor">142</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Vonnohâs <em>Girl Dancing</em> adapts a traditional Tanagra
                  theme that was also the modern one of a young woman dressed up
                  for a quadrille, and âsomehow brings to the gazerâs mind,â the
                  critic Elizabeth Semple remarked, âa vivid sense of what is
                  meant by the phrase 'poetry of motion.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn143" id="fnref143" class="footnote-ref-anchor">143</a></sup>
                  <em>The Fan</em> (cat. no. 47) transports another Tanagra
                  model of femininity into the modern age with a pensive young
                  woman in a fashionable tea gown standing with an open feather
                  fan at her side. This figurine is an extremely rare surviving
                  exampleâone of threeâof Vonnohâs work in terracotta,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn144" id="fnref144" class="footnote-ref-anchor">144</a></sup>
                  which she took up around 1910, experimenting with different
                  types of clay and degrees of firing and even acquiring a kiln
                  of her own. âOf all the work I have ever done,â she said, the
                  terracottas best reflected her ambition âto have each figure
                  as complete an example of personal work as a picture is of
                  that of the painter.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn145" id="fnref145" class="footnote-ref-anchor">145</a></sup>

                  An undated photograph of Bessie Potter Vonnoh shows the
                  sculptor dressed in an artistâs smock, seated in the studio,
                  lost in admiration of one of her own figurines (fig. 1.19).
                  Although the circumstances of the photograph are unknown,
                  Vonnoh appears to have fallen, perhaps ironically, into what
                  had become, by the turn of the century, a visual trope in
                  American art. The archetype may be GÃ©rÃ´meâs female coroplast
                  (see fig. 1.5): Vonnoh, too, is the creator of the work of art
                  she contemplates, of which copies would be made for the
                  marketplace. Other American works on the theme show
                  well-dressed modern women passively appreciating objects of
                  ancient artistry: <em>Tanagra</em> (1901) by Elliott
                  Daingerfield (fig. 1.20), <em>The Tanagra</em> (by 1909) by
                  Thomas Anshutz (fig. 4.13), and
                  <em><a href="https://americanart.si.edu/artwork/tanagra-figure-1353" target="_blank">The Tanagra Figure</a></em>
                  (1924) by Alice Pike Barney (1857â1931) all present the
                  principal female figure reflecting upon her miniaturized
                  equivalent in clay.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn146" id="fnref146" class="footnote-ref-anchor">146</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  A late example of the theme is
                  <em>Tanagra (The Builders)</em> (cat. no. 45) by the American
                  Impressionist Childe Hassam (1859â1935). Its two-part title,
                  considered by the contemporary critic Royal Cortissoz âonly
                  nominally relevant,â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn147" id="fnref147" class="footnote-ref-anchor">147</a></sup>
                  may express the artistâs ambivalence about the premise of the
                  painting, which he defined in 1920 as a âblonde Aryan girl
                  holding a Tanagra figurine.â We can just see âthe buildersâ
                  through the top-floor window of the New York apartment; the
                  secondary theme of urban progress is symbolized, according to
                  Hassam, by the Chinese lilies, âspringing up from the
                  bulbs.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn148" id="fnref148" class="footnote-ref-anchor">148</a></sup>
                  Yet the figurine is not a Tanagra at all. It may be a replica
                  in miniature of a Greco-Roman Venus, perhaps made of faÃ¯ence
                  or colored marble of the kind one might purchase in a souvenir
                  shop. More consistent with the Tanagra type is the life-size
                  figure with the Archaic smile, an overgrown example wearing a
                  Knidian hairstyle and a draping negligÃ©e. Her chalky
                  complexion and pallid features suggest a fading polychromy;
                  her disproportionately long left arm might be appropriated
                  from a different figurine, or else dislocated from its socket,
                  as it turns from the elbow at an unnatural angle.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The figure stands wedged between a polished mahogany table and
                  a Japanese folding screen, whose vivid colors and patterns are
                  abstracted and dimly reflected in her filmy garment so that
                  she appears pinned to the dÃ©cor. The tall window offers no
                  escape, as a table has been set in front of it for the purpose
                  of forcing the paperwhite bulbs; sheer curtains have been
                  pulled aside to admit daylight and reveal the view, with only
                  a high, pale rectangle of sky representing the natural world.
                  The oppressive air of <em>Tanagra (The Builders)</em> belies
                  the optimistic message Hassam claims to have intended, âthe
                  groth [<em>sic</em>] of a great city.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn149" id="fnref149" class="footnote-ref-anchor">149</a></sup>
                  The layers of culture confining the figure may be meant to
                  buffer the shock of the modernâthe outside world that had
                  recently entered the First World War. Perhaps the artist
                  regarded the so-called Tanagra figurine as an emblem of
                  Western civilization, which the âAryanâ woman holds out like a
                  talisman against the inevitability of change.
                </p>
                <h2>Conversing with the past</h2>
                <p>
                  For the ancient Greeks who made and consumed the Tanagra
                  figurines, the terracottas represented the feminine ideal, âa
                  well-dressed, mature woman . . . valued in the home, in the
                  sanctuary, and in the afterlife.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn150" id="fnref150" class="footnote-ref-anchor">150</a></sup>
                  For the late Victorian scholars who studied and collected
                  them, they reconfigured their concept of antique statuary,
                  casting it in living color and offering access to âa Greece
                  they could feel close to, . . . a Greece that was already
                  bourgeois.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn151" id="fnref151" class="footnote-ref-anchor">151</a></sup>
                  But after the turn of the twentieth century, the Tanagras
                  began to lose their glamour. They were dispersed from private
                  collections and removed from museum displays out of a combined
                  fear of forgery and antipathy toward Victorian taste. The term
                  âTanagra,â however, lived on, and expanded to embrace the new
                  movement of womenâs liberation. The Italian feminist Rosa
                  Genoni (1867â1954), an outspoken opponent of the first World
                  War and the Fascist regime, designed the
                  <a href="http://vestoj.com/app/uploads/2017/11/BorelliTanagraGenonicopy.jpg" target="_blank">Tanagra Dress</a>
                  in 1908 to wear when addressing the first Italian National
                  Congress of Women. Challenging the contemporary taste for
                  closely tailored styles, the dress balanced âthe stitched and
                  the draped,â as the fashion historian Eugenia Paulicelli has
                  noted, and made âa statement of a strong female identity and
                  personality.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn152" id="fnref152" class="footnote-ref-anchor">152</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In <em>The Modern Parisienne</em> of 1912, Octave Uzanne
                  writes that âthe lady of societyâ had at last achieved the
                  freedom to choose how she âset off her elegance and beautyâ
                  while at home: âShe has rediscovered the art of drapery, of
                  arranging materials of harmonious folds, and sometimes
                  delights to wrap herself in clinging gauzy stuffs like the
                  delicious Tanagra statuettes.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn153" id="fnref153" class="footnote-ref-anchor">153</a></sup>
                  That new attitude toward tailoring became public in 1913, with
                  a new âsilhouette Ã  la modeâ predicated on a misunderstanding
                  of Tanagra drapery as âdrawn up in front and low at the backâ
                  (fig. 1.21).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn154" id="fnref154" class="footnote-ref-anchor">154</a></sup>
                  Although the new fashion was adopted by Parisian ladies as
                  markers of their modernity, they still felt compelled, as the
                  writer Colette noted in her memoirs, to wear a long âTanagra
                  corsetâ underneath, lest their loose garb reflect upon their
                  morals.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn155" id="fnref155" class="footnote-ref-anchor">155</a></sup>
                  The liberating connotations of the term âTanagraâ were also
                  cast on the art of dance, most famously in Martha Grahamâs
                  debut performance as a choreographer in 1926. In
                  <em>Tanagra,</em> Graham (1894â1991) appeared on stage as a
                  figurine in motion, âa Greek figure with a fan, who handled
                  her soft draperies deftly and made beautiful pictures against
                  the black back-dropâ (fig. 1.22).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn156" id="fnref156" class="footnote-ref-anchor">156</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Like all popular manias, the enthusiasm for Tanagra figurines,
                  and even for the lilting tone of the word itself, eventually
                  faded away. During the postwar period, the terracottas all but
                  disappeared from view, except to the scholars who studied
                  them, and even they were discomfited by the Tanagrasâ easy
                  charm: in 1948, one classicist belittled them in his book on
                  Greek ceramics as âyoung women of light calibre pulling their
                  dresses into pretty patterns.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn157" id="fnref157" class="footnote-ref-anchor">157</a></sup>
                  Although Reynold Higgins confidently expected a revival of the
                  taste for them as part of the resurgence of Victoriana in the
                  1960s,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn158" id="fnref158" class="footnote-ref-anchor">158</a></sup>
                  the twentieth century, it seems, took little notice of the
                  ancient terracottas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was only in 2003 that the figurines returned to the
                  limelight, introduced to the new millennium with
                  <em>Tanagra: Mythe et archÃ©ologie</em>, an exhibition
                  organized by the Louvre and the Montreal Museum of Fine
                  Arts.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn159" id="fnref159" class="footnote-ref-anchor">159</a></sup>
                  Though dominated by terracottas from the Louvreâs collection,
                  the exhibition gathered figurines from various European
                  museums, which were shown together with a number of
                  nineteenth-century works cast in their image. Another version
                  of that exhibition,
                  <em>Tanagras: Figurines for Life and Eternity,</em> was staged
                  in Valencia, Spain, in 2010.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn160" id="fnref160" class="footnote-ref-anchor">160</a></sup>
                  Dispensing with the nineteenth-century context, it focused
                  entirely on the Louvre Tanagras, and its outstanding
                  catalogue, published in Spanish and English, offers new
                  art-historical scholarship and technical research, providing a
                  fresh foundation for the further study of Tanagra figurines.

                  Whistlerâs lithographs, after a period of acclaim in the
                  1890s, had also fallen out of public favor in the twentieth
                  century. For all the artistâs efforts to the contrary,
                  lithography remained closely associated with industrial
                  printing and poster art, and the particular delicacy of
                  Whistlerâs lithographs made them difficult to reproduce to
                  good advantage. Moreover, in comparison with his etchings,
                  which had always been held in high esteem, and his paintings,
                  which included one of the icons of American art, Whistlerâs
                  lithographs seemed insubstantial and insignificant. In 1998,
                  however, an exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago revived
                  popular and scholarly enthusiasm for this aspect of Whistlerâs
                  production.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn161" id="fnref161" class="footnote-ref-anchor">161</a></sup>
                  <em>Songs on Stone: James McNeill Whistler and the Art of
                    Lithography</em>
                  not only brought the prints out of storage but celebrated the
                  publication of a catalogue raisonnÃ©,
                  <em>The Lithographs of James McNeill Whistler,</em> the
                  product of a decadeâs research by a gifted team of
                  scholars.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn162" id="fnref162" class="footnote-ref-anchor">162</a></sup>
                  The comprehensive exhibition and magisterial catalogue
                  together reinstated the significance, and demonstrated the
                  unutterable charm, of this genre of Whistlerâs art.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Emanating from Paris and Chicago, those projects are models of
                  art-historical and technical research. They recontextualize
                  the art of Hellenistic terracottas and Whistler lithographs
                  for the twenty-first century, taking their nineteenth-century
                  âdiscoveryâ into account. <em>Recasting Antiquity</em> could
                  not have been organized without them, and our work draws from
                  their scholarship to configure a new, and appropriately
                  miniaturized, interpretation of Whistlerâs art and Tanagra
                  terracottas. Comprising some fifty objects, the exhibition
                  juxtaposes modern works on paper with the ancient figurines
                  that inspired them, allowing us to better understand how
                  artists conduct conversations with the past, and how the
                  notion of Tanagras as models of ideal femininity was recast
                  from antiquity to suit the desires of the modern day.
