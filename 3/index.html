    <title>Models of Antiquity | Recasting Antiquity</title>

    <meta name="description" content="In the 1930s, during America's worst financial crises, the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt employed photographers to document the plight of everyday folk in the Great Depression in order to push forward with their New Deal programs. Documentary photographers Dorothea Lange and Walker Evans were prolific frontrunners of these efforts and their extraordinary photographs continue to endure today. Their artistic and documentary mastery and historical importance provide key insight into a monumental turning point in American history.">

                    Professional models are a purely modern invention. To the
                    Greeks, for instance, they were quite unknown.
                  </p>
                  <p>âOscar Wilde, âLondon Models,â 1899</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  The models who arrived at Whistlerâs studio around 1890 were
                  invited to remove their hats, coats, corsets, and boots, and
                  leave their cares and inhibitions at the door. Once inside,
                  they might don some diaphanous drapery, perhaps with a
                  kerchief to hold back their hair, or they might wear nothing
                  at all. The furnishings were sparse in the cavernous space,
                  but there was a stove for warmth, a sofa for naps, and other
                  small comforts to help the models feel at home. We know from
                  one eyewitness that Whistler did not expect them to strike a
                  pose; they were free to wander about the studioâlounging,
                  dancing, readingâuntil some unconscious movement or attitude
                  caught the artistâs eye and âseemed to him a picture.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref-anchor">1</a></sup>
                  The resulting âfiguresâ (as images of nude and draped models
                  are known) were often rendered in the form of lithographs,
                  prints that capture and multiply the lightest touch of the
                  artistâs hand.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although Whistler referred to these easygoing studio pictures
                  simply as âdraped &amp; nude figures,â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" class="footnote-ref-anchor">2</a></sup>
                  scholars and collectors often call them âTanagras,â a title of
                  convenience we are happy to adopt.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" class="footnote-ref-anchor">3</a></sup>
                  The term is properly applied to the ancient terracotta
                  figurines unearthed during the final decades of the nineteenth
                  century around the ancient city of Tanagra, in the Boeotian
                  region of Greece, but it evokes the delicate grace that
                  distinguishes this category of Whistlerâs imagery. His
                  so-called Tanagras do not depict Tanagra figurines, which
                  typically depict a body enveloped in drapery, but they
                  represent a similarly informal interpretation of a statelier
                  classical style.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If Whistler never explicitly related his assertively modern
                  works to the ancient terracottas, he tacitly acknowledged the
                  aesthetic affinities that were obvious to his contemporaries.
                  Perhaps the first to make the connection was Oscar Wilde, who
                  in 1882 associated Whistlerâs art with Tanagra figurines, each
                  âas delicate in perfect workmanship and as simple in natural
                  motiveâ as the other.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" class="footnote-ref-anchor">4</a></sup>
                  Elizabeth Robins Pennell, in an 1897 article for
                  <em>Scribnerâs Magazine</em> written in close consultation
                  with the artist, observed that âthese studies have been
                  likened, more than once, to the work of Tanagra; and justly,
                  for theirs is the same flawless daintiness, the same purity of
                  pose, the same harmony of line, the same grace of
                  contour.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" class="footnote-ref-anchor">5</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  James Abbott (later McNeill) Whistler was born in
                  Massachusetts, but his life as an artist began in Paris.
                  Arriving at age twenty-one, he was already fluent in French
                  from a childhood spent in imperial Saint Petersburg, and he
                  was conversant with the culture of the Latin Quarter from
                  repeated readings of Henri Murgerâs
                  <em>Scenes of Bohemian Life.</em> Nominally an art student,
                  Whistler never submitted to the traditional academic training
                  that would have compelled him to draw from plaster casts of
                  classical sculptures before proceeding, at length, to drawing
                  from life, or the nude model, and it was not until years
                  later, when he was already established as an artist in London,
                  that he came to appreciate the cost of his neglect. In 1867, a
                  well-respected art critic condemned Whistlerâs figures as
                  poorly drawn, âan impertinence of which the artist ought to be
                  as much ashamed as we hope he would be if found in a
                  drawing-room with a dirty face.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" class="footnote-ref-anchor">6</a></sup>
                  He was indeed chagrined. âWhat a frightful education I gave
                  myself,â Whistler lamented to Henri Fantin-Latour, his best
                  friend in Paris, âor rather what a terrible lack of education
                  I feel I have had!â Under the âodiousâ influence of Gustave
                  Courbet, he had allowed the attractions of Realism to lure him
                  from the studio. Now, at age thirty-three, he would have to
                  start over from the very beginning. âIâm sure I will make up
                  for the time Iâve wastedâbut what difficulties,â he wrote. âI
                  spend the whole day drawing from models!!â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" class="footnote-ref-anchor">7</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  With his new friend Albert Joseph Moore (1841â1893), an
                  English artist equally lacking in formal training, Whistler
                  practiced making âacademy studiesâ from the nude figure. Until
                  then, his artworks had depicted scenes from modern life, while
                  Mooreâs had tended toward antiquity, visions of beauty remote
                  from the contemporary world. With his meticulous working
                  methods and high aesthetic ideals, Moore was the antithesis
                  ofâand for Whistler, the antidote toâRealism and Courbet.
                  Whistler carried out his remedial project from a rented studio
                  overlooking the British Museum, which housed the architectural
                  sculpture from the Parthenon. For Whistler and his
                  contemporaries, the Elgin Marbles represented the summit of
                  artistic achievement: âthe best and highestânever likely, or
                  even possible, to be excelled in any future age of the
                  world.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" class="footnote-ref-anchor">8</a></sup>
                  Thus it was that Whistler attempted to formulate an original
                  approach to ideal, or abstract, beauty in the shadow of that
                  epitome of perfection.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In keeping with the seriousness of his enterprise, Whistlerâs
                  âacademicâ drawings from the latter 1860s appear studiously
                  remote and disaffected. He was undoubtedly intimidated by his
                  project, as a passage in Pennellâs <em>Scribnerâs</em> article
                  implies: âBy his drawing of the nude, the measure of an
                  artistâs capacityâor incapacityâmay be judged. By it he stands
                  convicted of perfection, or of failure as it may be and too
                  often is.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" class="footnote-ref-anchor">9</a></sup>
                  <em>Standing Nude</em> (fig. 3.1), an overdetermined effort to
                  portray the calm repose of classical art, betrays Whistlerâs
                  own discomfort with both the female nude and the academic
                  exercise. The unnamed figure (inevitably called âVenusâ) is
                  vaguely reminiscent of antique statuaryâlike the
                  <a href="https://www.uffizi.it/en/artworks/medici-venus" target="_blank">Medici Venus</a>, her right arm shields her breasts, and like the
                  <a href="https://www.louvre.fr/en/explore/the-palace/ideal-greek-beauty" target="_blank">Venus de Milo</a>, her left arm is absent altogetherâwhich suggests, as
                  Margaret MacDonald has observed, âthat the themes and
                  variations of classical art were more or less absorbed in
                  Whistlerâs consciousness.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" class="footnote-ref-anchor">10</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Although shaded like a finished drawing, Whistlerâs
                  <em>Standing Nude</em> was intended as a cartoon, or a
                  full-size pattern for a painting, in which the figure would be
                  clothed, or as the artist informed a potential patron in 1869,
                  âclad in thin transparent drapery.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" class="footnote-ref-anchor">11</a></sup>
                  A small oil sketch made to determine the color scheme, a
                  custom adopted from Moore, provides a key to Whistlerâs vision
                  for the final work (cat. no. 14). A violet scarf tied around
                  the figureâs head swirls behind her to connect with the
                  white-dotted sash pulled across her body and gathered lightly
                  with a swathe of pink drapery in one hand; the other holds a
                  circular Japanese fan like the ones pinned arbitrarily to the
                  wall behind her. That unexpected accessory emblematizes the
                  wave of inspiration flowing from Japan, which Moore and
                  Whistler both insinuated into their classicizing art. Standing
                  beside the figure is a slender blue and white vase evocative
                  of Chinese porcelain; it holds vivid purple irises that pick
                  up the shade of the sash like the thread of an embroidery, as
                  Whistler explained his technique, âthe whole forming in this
                  way an harmonious <em>pattern</em>.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" class="footnote-ref-anchor">12</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whistlerâs little oil, known for decades as <em>Tanagra</em>,
                  was long believed by many scholars (including myself) to be an
                  homage to the ancient terracottas.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" class="footnote-ref-anchor">13</a></sup>
                  We were led astray by the title, posthumously assigned to the
                  sketch because of its presumed connection with a pastel
                  drawing once exhibited by that name.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" class="footnote-ref-anchor">14</a></sup>
                  But even without its Greek misnomer, Whistlerâs elegantly
                  draped figure, fan in hand, resembles a Tanagra figurine, and
                  the small scale, delicate facture, and muted colors of the
                  work lend further support to the association. It is unlikely,
                  however, that Whistler or anyone else in his circle had ever
                  laid eyes on an actual Tanagra as early as 1869, when the oil
                  sketch was made.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" class="footnote-ref-anchor">15</a></sup>
                  As the Louvre historian NÃ©guine Mathieux has remarked, certain
                  artists were painting âTanagras,â or âyoung draped women
                  depicted with an idealized grace and in pastel colours,â even
                  before the actual Tanagra figurines were unearthed in
                  Greece.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" class="footnote-ref-anchor">16</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  That Whistler fell under the spell of the terracotta figurines
                  has never been in doubt. They offered a welcome alternative to
                  the implacable perfection of classical Greek art, adhering to
                  a more attainable standard of beauty and personifying a more
                  modern sensibility. âThe calm repose of antique art is here
                  replaced by vivacity and movement,â the antiquarian Frederic
                  Vors observed in 1879: âThey are the embodiment of momentary
                  action and transitory motion.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" class="footnote-ref-anchor">17</a></sup>
                  Whistlerâs silence on the subject makes it impossible to know
                  exactly when, or how, he first encountered the Tanagras,
                  though hints of influence begin turning up in his works around
                  1873, just as the figurines were making their way into museum
                  collections and private hands. Katharine Lochnan has
                  identified an etching of a draped standing figure (fig. 3.2)
                  as the first of the âTanagras,â detecting in the hairstyle a
                  hint of the distinctive âmelonâ coiffure and noting in the
                  drapery the arrangement of chiton and mantle that make up the
                  Tanagra costume.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" class="footnote-ref-anchor">18</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Beyond such visual clues, which might also point to a
                  continuing engagement with the classical, only circumstantial
                  evidence supports the speculation that as early as the 1870s,
                  Tanagras inspired Whistlerâs creativity. In fact, the only
                  irrefutable physical evidence that the artist ever
                  acknowledged the aesthetic possibilities of the ancient
                  terracottas is a faint pencil sketch of a photograph (fig.
                  3.3) of a single statuette (fig. 3.4), which could not have
                  been made before the mid 1890s. The sketch is preserved in an
                  album that was probably lent to the artist by his friend
                  Alexander A. Ionides (1840â1898), who possessed a celebrated
                  collection of Tanagras and thus became, in the words of John
                  Sandberg, the artistâs âdirect path to classical
                  antiquity.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" class="footnote-ref-anchor">19</a></sup>

                <p>
                  Aleco, as Alexander Alexander Ionides was known to his
                  friends, met Whistler in Paris in 1855. He was there to
                  improve his French, although at sixteen he already spoke it
                  like a native, according to George du Maurier, whose 1894
                  novel <em>Trilby</em> is based on his own reminiscences of his
                  art-student days. âThe Greek,â as du Maurier calls Aleco, was
                  popular with the artists âfor his <em>bonhomie,</em> his
                  niceness, his warm geniality,â and also because âhe was the
                  capitalist of this select circle (and nobly lavish of his
                  capital).â When Whistler and his Parisian colleagues
                  âtransferred their bohemia to Londonâ around 1860, they were
                  warmly welcomed to the Ionidesâs gracious family home in Tulse
                  Hill, in the outskirts of town.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20" class="footnote-ref-anchor">20</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The patriarch was Alexander Constantine Ionides (1810â1890),
                  who had fled Constantinople in 1827, eventually settling in
                  London with his wife, Euterpe Sgouta. Over the years, he
                  shifted the family business from the import trade to merchant
                  banking, and from 1854 to 1866 acted as consul general for
                  Greece. Within months of Alecoâs birth in 1840, his father
                  commissioned a
                  <a href="https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O81538/the-family-of-alexander-constantine-oil-painting-watts-george-frederick/" target="_blank">family portrait</a>, in which the chubby-cheeked baby poses with his elder
                  brothers Constantine (1833â1900) and Luke (1837â1924), both in
                  traditional Greek costume. The portraitist, George Frederic
                  Watts, became a close family friend, and it was he who called
                  the elder Ionidesâs attention to the first work Whistler
                  exhibited at the Royal Academy,
                  <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/at-the-piano-james-mcneill-whistler/YwF14p8hP3gL9Q?hl=en" target="_blank"><em>At the Piano.</em></a>
                  Consequently, Ionides commissioned Whistler to paint a
                  <a href="https://addison.andover.edu/search-the-collection/?embark_query=/objects-1/info?query=mfs%20all%20%22whistler%22&amp;sort=0&amp;page=2&amp;objectName=Brown%20and%20Silver:%20Old%20Battersea%20Bridge" target="_blank">Thames scene</a>
                  and
                  <a href="https://whistlerpaintings.gla.ac.uk/catalogue/display/?mid=y032" target="_blank">a portrait of his son Luke</a>,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21" class="footnote-ref-anchor">21</a></sup>
                  and went on to encourage his own children and others in his
                  extended family to support young artists trying to find a
                  foothold in the competitive London art world.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22" class="footnote-ref-anchor">22</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Euterpe Ionides sold her diamonds in 1864, or so the story
                  goes, to buy No. 1 Holland Park, a newly constructed mansion
                  in a fashionable Kensington neighborhood. Whistler was a
                  frequent visitor to the house until 1867, when he was involved
                  in a dispute with his own brother-in-law, and Aleco was the
                  only member of his family to take the artistâs side.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23" class="footnote-ref-anchor">23</a></sup>
                  Some years later, when Whistlerâs brother William married
                  Alecoâs cousin Helen (known as Nellie), the friendship was
                  sealed with a family bond. By then, Aleco Ionides had become
                  âa swell,â as Whistler remarked in 1873, by which he meant a
                  distinguished person with a prospering career in the City.
                  Aleco was also beginning to manage the household in Holland
                  Park while his parents gradually retired to Windycroft, their
                  country home near Hastings.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24" class="footnote-ref-anchor">24</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1875, Aleco Ionides married Isabella Sechiari, another
                  member of the Anglo-Greek community, though born in Marseille.
                  On their honeymoon in Paris, they visited the Louvre expressly
                  to see the Tanagra figurines. The museum had made its initial
                  acquisitions in 1872, assisted by the young archaeologist
                  Olivier Rayet, who had been in Athens when the figurines first
                  appeared on the market. By 1874, over sixty âspecimensâ went
                  on display in mahogany cases lining the walls of the Charles X
                  Gallery (fig. 3.5).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25" class="footnote-ref-anchor">25</a></sup>
                  Aleco and Isabella may have been motivated to see the
                  collection for themselves by an illustrated article published
                  in the April issue of the
                  <em>Gazette des Beaux-Arts</em> (cat. no. 49). Written by
                  Rayet himself, it provided an âhistoric and descriptive
                  account of the curious statuettes and other small works of
                  Greek art discovered at Tanagra in Boeotia.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26" class="footnote-ref-anchor">26</a></sup>

                  Although the Louvre collection was considerably larger, the
                  Ionides familyâs collection was âas perfect,â the newlyweds
                  decided.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27" class="footnote-ref-anchor">27</a></sup>
                  From that observation we may surmise that it had effectively
                  taken shape by 1875. Marcus B. Huish, writing in 1898, begins
                  his chronicle of the Ionides collection âsome five-and-twenty
                  years ago,â when âthe spade awoke from their sleep of
                  centuries the assemblage of elegant and coquettish figurines
                  which had only to be seen to be appreciated.â Aleco Ionides
                  was âon the spot,â according to Huishâa statement that cannot
                  be verified and may have been contrived to confirm the
                  collectionâs authenticity.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28" class="footnote-ref-anchor">28</a></sup>
                  Nevertheless, Alecoâs father probably retained diplomatic ties
                  from his term as consul general, and the familyâs connections
                  with the Archaeological Society of Athens (though it did not
                  begin to excavate the site until 1874) may also have
                  facilitated the acquisition and export of fresh antiquities
                  from Tanagra.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29" class="footnote-ref-anchor">29</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Over the next few years, as Alecoâs social standing roseâhe
                  himself was appointed Greek consul general in 1883âhis
                  holdings of Tanagra figurines continued to expand, and in
                  January 1885 the collection earned official sanction with an
                  exhibition at the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria
                  &amp; Albert).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30" class="footnote-ref-anchor">30</a></sup>
                  Once back at Holland Park, the figurines were installed in a
                  drawing room recently remodeled into an âantiquities room,â
                  which gave them pride of place. The artist Walter Crane
                  (1845â1915) had been commissioned to create a showcase for
                  their display (fig. 3.6), a two-tiered, pedimented structure
                  which surmounted the fireplace like an overmantel, that
                  typically Victorian construction designed to draw attention to
                  the hearth of the home by surrounding it with the ownerâs
                  possessions. Crane described his construction as âa sort of
                  temple-like cabinetâ made of ebony, with columns of red and
                  yellow marble, âmidway in tone between the extremes of light
                  terra-cotta and dark limestone.â On the lower level, Doric
                  columns defined seven arched niches with gilded recesses for
                  individual figurines; the upper tier, in the correct Ionic
                  order, was divided into three sections to give special
                  prominence to prized terracottas.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31" class="footnote-ref-anchor">31</a></sup>

                  The shrine was designed to hold the collection as it stood in
                  1889, when it was photographed by Bedford Lemere, together
                  with other rooms and works of art at Holland Park. Those
                  photographs illustrate an account of the Ionides house written
                  by the designer Lewis&nbsp;F.&nbsp;Day and published in the
                  <em>Art Journal</em> in 1893 (cat. no. 53). According to Day,
                  who would have heard it from Aleco, those original figurines
                  were âamong the first found at Tanagra, before ever forgeries
                  were thought of.â By then, the trade in forgeries was openly
                  acknowledged: the first had been made around 1876, and ten
                  years later it was estimated that three times as many fake as
                  genuine terracottas were sold each year.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32" class="footnote-ref-anchor">32</a></sup>
                  Nevertheless, Aleco persevered, trusting his eye and intuition
                  despite persistent reports of fraud in the antiquities market.
                  Indeed, Day mentions two recently acquired Tanagra statuettes
                  that were too new and probably too ornate to find a place in
                  the overmantel. Those mythological subjects, sure to appeal to
                  late-Victorian taste, were almost certainly forgeries (fig.
                  3.7).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33" class="footnote-ref-anchor">33</a></sup>

                  In the dining room, lavishly decorated by Crane and William
                  Morris, Whistlerâs self-portrait,
                  <a href="https://dia.org/collection/arrangement-gray%3A-portrait-painter-64930" target="_blank"><em>Arrangement in Grey</em></a>, hung prominently beside the fireplace. Aleco had inherited
                  the painting upon his fatherâs death in November 1890,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34" class="footnote-ref-anchor">34</a></sup>
                  just after acquiring a Whistler of his own,
                  <em><a href="https://asia.si.edu/explore-art-culture/collections/search/edanmdm:fsg_F1909.127a-b/" target="_blank">Nocturne in Blue and Gold: Valparaiso</a>,</em>
                  a more radical example of the artistâs increasingly abstract
                  style*.* Because the walls at Holland Park were by then
                  replete with pictures, the Nocturne would hang at Homewood,
                  the familyâs country house in Surrey, where the light, in any
                  case, was âso much better for it,â Aleco assured his
                  friend.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35" class="footnote-ref-anchor">35</a></sup>
                  At least initially, Aleco proved to be among the rare few who
                  lived up to the artistâs expectations of those who owned his
                  worksâor cared for them on his behalf, as Whistler understood
                  the situation. Aleco generously allowed his new acquisition to
                  be exhibited in the Grand Palais des Champs-ÃlysÃ©es in 1890
                  and again in London in 1892, at the Whistler retrospective
                  held at the Goupil Gallery. Indeed, on the latter occasion,
                  Aleco offered to lend every Whistler painting in his
                  possession.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36" class="footnote-ref-anchor">36</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The reason for his magnanimity became apparent when Aleco
                  Ionides allowed <em>Nocturne in Blue and Gold</em> to be sold
                  from the walls of the Goupil exhibition. To Whistlerâs dismay,
                  Aleco had become one of many old friends and acquaintances who
                  capitalized on the phenomenal rise in the artistâs reputation.
                  âHow shockingly they have all behaved about my pictures,â
                  Whistler complained to his sister-in-law about her Greek
                  relations, Aleco in particular. A few months later he informed
                  her bitterly that Aleco had received Â£200 for âanother little
                  <a href="https://www.artic.edu/artworks/81572/trouville-grey-and-green-the-silver-sea" target="_blank">sea piece</a>
                  of mine,â purchased for around Â£20 soon after it was painted
                  in Trouville in 1865, or so the artist recollected.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37" class="footnote-ref-anchor">37</a></sup>
                  As it happened, the sale of the Whistlers portended a
                  precipitous fall in the fortunes of Aleco Ionides. In March
                  1894, he approached David Croal Thomson, Whistlerâs dealer at
                  Goupil, about selling
                  <em>Brown and Silver: Old Battersea Bridge,</em> the painting
                  his father had commissioned and he had inherited when his
                  mother died in 1892. âI fear he is very hard pressed at the
                  present,â Thomson wrote to Whistler, âfor he spoke of getting
                  rid of his whole house &amp; its contents.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38" class="footnote-ref-anchor">38</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whistler, affronted that Aleco had not told him personally,
                  was nonetheless aware of his old friendâs straitened
                  circumstances and agreed to help him sell his collection of
                  Tanagra figurines.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39" class="footnote-ref-anchor">39</a></sup>
                  Aleco probably enlisted Whistlerâs assistance because the
                  artist owed him a favor, after his generosity as a lender.
                  Moreover, Whistlerâs rising reputation in the international
                  art world meant that he would have the connections necessary
                  to effect a sale of such significance. The artistâs first
                  (perhaps only) thought was of Professor Emil Heilbut, a
                  scholar, collector, critic, and occasional art agent, who had
                  been the first person in Germany to acquire French
                  Impressionist paintings; because Heilbut was also one of
                  Whistlerâs greatest admirers, he could be counted on to
                  cooperate. In April 1894, Whistler offered to send photographs
                  of the Ionides Tanagras as soon as they were ready, and in
                  July, Heilbut paid a visit in person to Holland Park, later
                  writing to Whistler that he had found the collection
                  âadmirableâ and would do what he could to help sell it.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40" class="footnote-ref-anchor">40</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  A German buyer was not forthcoming, however, probably because
                  of the well-founded fear of forgeries. Thomson tried, to no
                  avail, to interest the American industrialist Alfred Atmore
                  Pope in the Tanagras, arranging for him to visit to Holland
                  Park, which Thomson had ârepresented,â Pope wrote afterward to
                  Whistler, âas the most artistically decorated house in London.
                  God help London then.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41" class="footnote-ref-anchor">41</a></sup>
                  While the collection languished, the strain on Aleco began to
                  tell. In a letter Whistler wrote that June to his brother
                  William, he mentioned Alecoâs distracted state: âI never know
                  whether he is not thinking of something else.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn42" id="fnref42" class="footnote-ref-anchor">42</a></sup>
                  Finally in 1895, the âlovely company of Tanagra figures,â
                  together with the other remaining works of art at No. 1
                  Holland Park, were packed up and sent to Bond Street for
                  exhibition, and implicitly for sale, in a show discreetly
                  titled <em>A Connoisseurâs Treasures</em>. Even though the
                  connoisseur was named only as âa distinguished amateur,â his
                  identity would have been an open secret in the London art
                  world.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn43" id="fnref43" class="footnote-ref-anchor">43</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whistler was living in Paris at the time, but he heard from
                  Thomson that the Ionides show was attracting many visitors,
                  although âvery little business is being done.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn44" id="fnref44" class="footnote-ref-anchor">44</a></sup>
                  The Tanagras did not attract the attention Aleco expected; he
                  had informed Marcus Huish âthat of all his beautiful things
                  none have so quickly appealed to all, no matter how varied
                  their tastes, as these groups and figures.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn45" id="fnref45" class="footnote-ref-anchor">45</a></sup>
                  One work did sell, howeverâ<em>Arrangement in Grey,</em> for
                  the considerable sum of Â£700, âa large price for a head,â
                  Whistler reflected, âeven though it be my own.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn46" id="fnref46" class="footnote-ref-anchor">46</a></sup>
                  Yet the artist was again irrationally incensed that Ionides
                  had realized so much profit from one of his works. âOut of
                  softness of heart,â he wrote to Aleco, in what would be his
                  last letter to his old friend,
                </p>
                <p>
                  I let you off a while agoâand tried to help you in the sale of
                  your Tanagras.

                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    But it is intolerable that all of you in England should

                    over &amp; over again, &amp; without a word to me pocket
                    sums that properly you should offer to me on your bended
                    knees saying behold the price we are at last able to obtain
                    for these valuable works we have had the privilege of living
                    with all these years for eighteen pence!
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Whistler seems to have regarded the album of Tanagra
                  photographs, which had remained in Thomsonâs hands for the
                  duration of the exhibition, as now belonging to him, perhaps
                  in compensation for what he regarded as his friendâs
                  ill-gotten gains.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn47" id="fnref47" class="footnote-ref-anchor">47</a></sup>
                  He kept it for the rest of his life, and at some point between
                  1895 and his death in 1903 sketched one of the figurines on a
                  blank album page (see fig. 3.4).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Tanagra terracottas remained unsold. Ionides had provided
                  for this eventuality in his will of 1889, stipulating that the
                  collection remain within the house at Holland Park as long as
                  it was occupied but then return to Greece, to the National
                  Archaeological Museum in Athens.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn48" id="fnref48" class="footnote-ref-anchor">48</a></sup>
                  The rest of the story is shrouded in mystery. A childhood
                  friend of Alecoâs who paid a call in 1897 found him as âkind
                  and affectionate as ever,â though âdown on his luck and
                  ill.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn49" id="fnref49" class="footnote-ref-anchor">49</a></sup>
                  At the end of that year, <em>The Studio</em> published a
                  richly illustrated account of the palace of art in Holland
                  Park, âAn Epoch-Making Houseâ by Gleeson White, and six months
                  later Marcus Huishâs article devoted to the Tanagras appeared
                  in the same publication*.*<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn50" id="fnref50" class="footnote-ref-anchor">50</a></sup>
                  Shortly after that, at the end of July 1898, Alexander A.
                  Ionides died at home, age 58, in circumstances that have never
                  been disclosed. No obituary appeared in the papers; indeed,
                  for all the familyâs prominence in London, there seems to have
                  been no official notice of his passing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  His fortune had dwindled, but Aleco Ionides did not die
                  destitute. The total estate was valued at around Â£19,000âthe
                  equivalent today of some $3.25 millionâwith small bequests to
                  charitable institutions in Athens, but most of the fortune he
                  left to his family.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn51" id="fnref51" class="footnote-ref-anchor">51</a></sup>
                  Isabella Ionides and the children deserted Holland Park for
                  their country home but kept the London house until 1908, when
                  it was sold to the trustees for the sixth Earl of Ilchester.
                  By then, the terracottas were long gone, though they had not
                  returned to Greece in accordance with Alecoâs wishes. âThe
                  Well-known Collection of Objects of Art formed by the late
                  Alexander A. [Aleco] Ionides Esq. of 1 Holland Park W.,
                  including an important series of Antiquities from BÅotia,
                  Tanagra, Greece, etc.,â had been dispersed at a Christieâs
                  auction on March 14, 1902, with the terracottas selling as a
                  single lot for Â£5,250.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn52" id="fnref52" class="footnote-ref-anchor">52</a></sup>
                  Apart from a few minor examples held by the Harvard Art
                  Museums (cat. no. 11), the Ionides collection has since
                  disappeared.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn53" id="fnref53" class="footnote-ref-anchor">53</a></sup>
                </p>
                <h2>The Models of Chelsea</h2>
                <p>
                  In February 1885, just as popular appreciation for Tanagra
                  figurines was coming into full flower, Whistler delivered a
                  lecture on art titled the âTen OâClockâ after the late-night
                  hour of its presentation. In that formal declaration of the
                  aestheticist creed, Whistler defines the artist as one âwho
                  delights in the dainty, the sharp, bright gaiety of beauty.â
                  âDaintyâ is not a word we often use today, except in reference
                  to something ridiculously delicate and out-of-date, but that
                  unassuming little adjective evoked, for Whistler, the highest
                  form of aesthetic beauty. Indeed, he envisioned art itself
                  (Art for Artâs Sake) as âa goddess of dainty thoughtâreticent
                  of habit, abjuring all obtrusiveness, purposing in no way to
                  better others.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn54" id="fnref54" class="footnote-ref-anchor">54</a></sup>
                  Rather like a Tanagra figurine, Whistlerâs muse is classical
                  in her allegorical aspect but naturalistic, even human, in her
                  capricious affectionsâwhich the artist had learned, to his
                  grief, never to take for granted.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We might expect to find Tanagras somewhere in the âTen
                  OâClock*,*â if only listed among the artworks sanctioned by
                  the goddess, but they are never mentioned by name. This may
                  have been because they were so much in fashion. Whistlerâs
                  discourse even criticizes the vogue for classical antiquity, a
                  flicker of hypocrisy seized upon by his sometime friend and
                  neighbor Oscar Wilde: âHas not Tite-street been thrilled with
                  the tidings that the models of Chelsea were posing to the
                  master, in peplums, for pastels?â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn55" id="fnref55" class="footnote-ref-anchor">55</a></sup>
                  Whistler was in fact making âstriking drawings of very
                  graceful figuresâ around that time, according to one visitor
                  to his Tite Street studio, though his models never posed in
                  âpeplums.â They posed in the nude, or draped in sheer fabrics
                  that revealed their natural form. As one critic noted dryly,
                  their âexcessively slight drapery is the result of some half
                  dozen strokes of the crayon.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn56" id="fnref56" class="footnote-ref-anchor">56</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Those works in pastel built uponâindeed, supersededâthe
                  serious studies from the life model that Whistler had made in
                  the 1860s and '70s to atone for his misspent youth. In at
                  least one case, <em>Note in Violet and Green</em> (fig. 3.8),
                  infrared photography reveals that Whistler simply added color
                  to an older drawing.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn57" id="fnref57" class="footnote-ref-anchor">57</a></sup>
                  And we can see from the reversal of the image that the pastel
                  known as
                  <em><a href="https://www.artnet.com/artists/james-abbott-mcneill-whistler/the-greek-slave-girl-variations-in-violet-and-PLEvJFCqggHEhVOZt6TrbA2" target="_blank">The Greek Slave Girl (Variations in Violet and Rose)</a></em>
                  was made from a tracing of Whistlerâs early lithograph
                  <em>Study</em> (see fig. 3.12).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn58" id="fnref58" class="footnote-ref-anchor">58</a></sup>
                  As revisions of monochrome figures, these colorful pastels may
                  have been inspired by the growing publicity surrounding
                  Tanagra figurines, which often called attention to âthe finely
                  powdered remains of a suit of paint.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn59" id="fnref59" class="footnote-ref-anchor">59</a></sup>
                  The vestiges of color clinging to the clay surfaces accounted
                  for much of their popular appeal; in an age obsessed with the
                  myth of Pygmalion, even the hint of color on an antique statue
                  made it seem to come alive, or at least appear more accessible
                  than the polished white marbles in the British Museum.

                  Upon seeing a selection of Whistlerâs pastels in 1885, the
                  neoclassical sculptor William Wetmore Story thrilled the
                  artist with his exclamation, âWhistler, they are as charming
                  and complete as a Tanagra statue!â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn60" id="fnref60" class="footnote-ref-anchor">60</a></sup>
                  The analogy may have been prompted by a work such as
                  <em>A Study in Red</em> (fig. 3.9), whose French title,
                  <em>Danseuse athÃ©nienne</em> (although not Whistlerâs),
                  provides a clue to a possible source of inspiration: the
                  famous terracotta figurine of a veiled dancer discovered in
                  1846 near the Athenian Acropolis and known as
                  <em>Danseuse Titeux</em>, or the <em>Titeux Dancer</em> (cat.
                  no. 1). That terracotta prototype, a pre-Tanagra figurine, had
                  become widely known to artists and antiquarians throughout
                  Europe,
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn61" id="fnref61" class="footnote-ref-anchor">61</a></sup>
                  and Whistler may have intended to recall the figure with his
                  own dancing girl, drawn in pastels on the rough brown paper
                  that approximated the texture and tonality of fired clay.

                  The <em>Pall Mall Gazette</em> described Whistlerâs âpastel
                  picturesâ of 1885 as âvery slight in themselves, of the female
                  nude, dignified and graceful in line and charmingly
                  chaste.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn62" id="fnref62" class="footnote-ref-anchor">62</a></sup>
                  That final quality may have been intended to distinguish
                  Whistlerâs works from the more lubricious, life-size Venuses
                  that had crowded the spring exhibitions. A letter to
                  <em>The Times</em> in May from âA British Matronâ protested
                  âthe display of nudity at the two principal galleries of
                  modern art in London,â prompting a flurry of correspondence as
                  artists and laypeople weighed in on the assumptionâas one
                  artist summarized the Matronâs point of viewââthat purity and
                  drapery are inseparable.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn63" id="fnref63" class="footnote-ref-anchor">63</a></sup>
                  The controversy culminated with the Royal Academician John
                  Callcott Horsley accusing his fellow artists of debasing young
                  girls by persuading them âso to ignore their natural modesty,
                  and quench their sense of true shame as to expose their
                  nakedness before men, and thus destroy all that is pure and
                  lovely in their womanhood.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn64" id="fnref64" class="footnote-ref-anchor">64</a></sup>
                  Thus the British Matronâs moral outrage was appended to a plea
                  for social reform: behind every nude picture, Horsley averred,
                  lay a woman posing naked for a pittance, scarcely better than
                  a prostitute.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In a <em>Punch</em> cartoon by Edward Linley Sambourne (fig.
                  3.10), the priggish Horsley becomes the artistâs model,
                  attired in bombazine to impersonate the anonymous author of
                  the letter to <em>The Times.</em> Recoiling in horror from the
                  Medici Venus, the Matron mutters, âOh, dear! Oh, dear! Who
                  could haâ sat for that?â
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn65" id="fnref65" class="footnote-ref-anchor">65</a></sup>
                  Models posing in the nude were not a recent phenomenon,
                  Sambourne implies, and Whistler himself could hardly wait âto
                  twit Horsley about the nude &amp; his absurd onslaught on it,â
                  as his friend Alan Cole noted in his diary.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn66" id="fnref66" class="footnote-ref-anchor">66</a></sup>

                <p>
                  The opportunity arose in December 1885, when Whistlerâs own
                  nearly nude figures went on display at the Society of British
                  Artists. To the frame of one of them (probably
                  <em>Note in Violet and Green</em>, see fig. 3.8), he affixed a
                  label imprinted, âHorsley soit qui mal y pense.â If now
                  abstruse, the quip was readily understood in its time as a
                  play on the motto of the chivalric Order of the Garter,
                  <em>Honi soit qui mal y pense,</em> meaning, âShame on anyone
                  who thinks evil of it,â in Old Anglo-Norman. One journalist
                  construed Whistlerâs act as âan indignant protest against the
                  idea that there is any immorality in the nude,â
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn67" id="fnref67" class="footnote-ref-anchor">67</a></sup>
                  but the artistâs objection was more encompassing. He regarded
                  the current debate as the extreme conclusion of the misguided
                  conflation of art and morality that had long encumbered
                  British culture. To Whistler, the nude female figure, far from
                  representing immorality, embodied art in its purest, most
                  liberated, and most impractical form.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the end, the moral controversy incited by the British
                  Matron had little effect on the production of the Victorian
                  nude, as Alison Smith has argued, though it did lift the
                  artistâs model âout of the private space of the studio and
                  life class into the realm of public debate.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn68" id="fnref68" class="footnote-ref-anchor">68</a></sup>
                  Until then, the model had remained effectively invisible in
                  England. Respectable painters designed their studios with
                  separate entrances so that models could come and go without
                  being seen by other members of the household; and in the
                  context of the paintings for which they posed, models were
                  understood only in terms of the characters they impersonated.
                  âThey career gaily through all centuries and through all
                  costumes,â Oscar Wilde wrote of London models, âand, like
                  actors, are only interesting when they are not
                  themselves.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn69" id="fnref69" class="footnote-ref-anchor">69</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  That paradigm was shattered in 1887, when
                  <em>The Reading Girl</em> (fig. 3.11) was exhibited at the New
                  English Art Club. The âgirlâ in ThÃ©odore Rousselâs painting is
                  transparently the artistâs model, who has shed, for the
                  moment, both her costume and her character. Although at work,
                  she is not working, but is âburied,â as one critic remarked,
                  â(but the British matron will regret to find not hidden) in
                  the newspaper.â Although the painting has the polish of a
                  French Salon nude, the model herself, with reddened hands and
                  calloused feet, is shockingly real. âThere has been no attempt
                  to idealise the figure,â the critic continued. âIt is simply a
                  portrait of a rather underfed woman, who is content (at a
                  shilling an hour) to be naked and not ashamed.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn70" id="fnref70" class="footnote-ref-anchor">70</a></sup>

                  Indeed, as with Manetâs
                  <em><a href="https://www.musee-orsay.fr/fr/oeuvres/le-dejeuner-sur-lherbe-904" target="_blank">Le DÃ©jeuner sur lâherbe</a>,</em>
                  exhibited some twenty-five years earlier, it was the modelâs
                  lack of shame that most unsettled the critics. As surely as
                  her âunderfedâ form defied the prevailing preference for the
                  plump, her apparent ease with her own nakednessâespecially in
                  the tacit presence of the artistâopenly resisted the Victorian
                  ideal of femininity. âNo human being, we should imagine, could
                  take any pleasure in such a picture as this,â wrote the
                  <em>Spectator</em>. âIt is a degradation of Art.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn71" id="fnref71" class="footnote-ref-anchor">71</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whistler regarded <em>The Reading Girl</em> as âan
                  extraordinary picture.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn72" id="fnref72" class="footnote-ref-anchor">72</a></sup>
                  Roussel had been his âdeferential discipleâ since 1885,
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn73" id="fnref73" class="footnote-ref-anchor">73</a></sup>
                  and during the years of their closest association they
                  explored similar subjects, employed the same models, and
                  nourished each otherâs creativity. It has been suggested that
                  Whistlerâs lithograph
                  <em>The Little Nude Model, Reading</em> (cat. no. 19) was made
                  in response to Rousselâs painting, âadapting it to a more
                  spontaneous medium and intimate scale,â which may certainly be
                  the case, although the influence, it seems to me, could have
                  flowed in either direction.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn74" id="fnref74" class="footnote-ref-anchor">74</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whistlerâs âlittleâ nude (relative, perhaps, to Rousselâs big
                  one) perches on the edge of a low cabinet, attending to her
                  reading. Apart from the headscarf (which Whistler always calls
                  a cap), she wears not a stitch of clothing, though her
                  discarded draperies are heaped behind her on the tabletop; the
                  sketchy fireplace a few feet away implies the warmth that is
                  the necessary condition for posing in the nude. Like the girl
                  in Rousselâs painting, this one unwittingly draws attention to
                  herself as a <em>model,</em> as distinct from the impersonal
                  image of a generic body known simply as a <em>figure.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Indeed, from this point forward, the word âmodelâ slips into
                  Whistlerâs nomenclature, indicating the subtle shift in
                  direction we can follow in his art; the small group of
                  lithographs made in London just before 1890 depicts the model
                  outside her customary role, a strategy that allows us to
                  recognize the model behind the âfigure.â Often, she is
                  portrayed at restâabsorbed in a book (cat. no. 18), drinking
                  tea (cat. no. 16), pulling on (or lifting off) her drapery
                  (cat. no. 17) as though preparing for a session that has yet
                  to begin. And even though her occupation depends on her
                  ability to stand as still as a statue, Whistler sometimes
                  shows her in motion, or at least alive to its potential. In
                  <em>The Dancing Girl</em> (cat. no. 15), for example, the
                  model gingerly points one toe, as though testing the waters;
                  not yet prepared to abandon caution to the dance, she extends
                  one arm to release a cascade of drapery.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What we do not see in these images is evidence of
                  <em>work,</em> of models earning their hourly wage by holding
                  inauthentic attitudes under the artistâs direction. âIt is the
                  secret of much of the artificiality of modern art,â wrote
                  Oscar Wilde, âthis constant posing of pretty people.â
                  Whistlerâs follower Mortimer Menpes confirms that the artist
                  never prescribed a pose: âThere was no pulling about of
                  drapery, no gazing through arched hands, no special placing of
                  the body.â Whistlerâs unusually accommodating attitude may
                  reflect his conviction that âindustry in Art is a
                  necessityânot a virtue,â as he wrote in 1884, âand any
                  evidence of the same, in the production, is a blemish, not a
                  quality; a proof, not of achievement, but of absolutely
                  insufficient work, for work alone will efface the footsteps of
                  work.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn75" id="fnref75" class="footnote-ref-anchor">75</a></sup>
                  Not even the quasi-classical drapery that so often features in
                  these works performs its ostensible function. Too transparent
                  to conceal the body, too thin to keep it warm, and too generic
                  to represent a costume or disguise, the gossamer fabric simply
                  removes the model from the mundane. Formally, it enhances the
                  contours of the nude body, a trick Whistler learned from his
                  study of the Elgin Marbles. The âsecret of repeated line,â as
                  he calls the device in the âTen OâClock*,*â creates âthe
                  measured rhyme of lovely limb and draperies flowing in
                  unison.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn76" id="fnref76" class="footnote-ref-anchor">76</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  By doing away with poses that presume a plot and costumes that
                  identify a character, Whistler allows the model to feature as
                  an undisguised element in the process of art-making. To his
                  way of thinking, a picture of a female model is a picture of
                  nothing: a work of art without a subject, to be regarded on
                  its own terms and appreciated for its own sakeâa work of art
                  about the work of art. His insubstantial little images thus
                  threatened to dispel the grand illusion supporting the
                  industry of Victorian subject painting. Edward J. Poynter, the
                  estimable director of the National Gallery and soon-to-be
                  president of the Royal Academy, confided to Whistler in 1894
                  that he had not read <em>Trilby,</em> the popular novel about
                  an artistâs model in bohemian Paris: âI generally dislike
                  pictures of behind the scenes of an artistâs life being put
                  before the public.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn77" id="fnref77" class="footnote-ref-anchor">77</a></sup>
                  Whistlerâs Tanagra lithographsâlike <em>Trilby</em>, but in a
                  lower keyâoffer up the rudiments of art, stripping away the
                  mise-en-scÃ¨ne and laying bare the secrets of the studio.

                <h2>The Master of the Lithograph</h2>
                <p>
                  A lithograph is a work of art on paper, printed in ink, and
                  existing in multiple examples, called impressions. Of the many
                  processes for making prints, lithography is the most direct:
                  the image is rendered on a flat stone slab just as a sketch is
                  drawn on a piece of paper. The printing method depends on the
                  simple concept that oil and water do not mix. The lithographic
                  stone is prepared so that ink will adhere only to the greasy
                  sketched lines of the image, while a film of water clings to
                  the rest of the surface, preserving a pristine background.
                  Under immense pressure, the image is transferred to sheets of
                  dampened paper, though the resulting impressions rarely show
                  signs of the force of gravity. An etching, in contrast, which
                  is printed from an incised rather than a flat surface, always
                  bears the mark of the metal plate where its sharp edges were
                  impressed into the soft paper. In a lithograph, as if by
                  magic, the drawing is replicated without leaving a trace of
                  the effort involved in its production.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn78" id="fnref78" class="footnote-ref-anchor">78</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although lithography had always held potential as an artistic
                  medium, from the time of its invention in the late eighteenth
                  century it was used primarily as a cheap means of reproducing
                  images, particularly in commercial advertisements. In England,
                  it was Thomas Way (1836â1915), a professional printer with a
                  family business in Covent Garden, who âmade this matter of art
                  printing his particular affair,â as Whistler wrote in
                  retrospect, âand it is to him entirely that is due the revival
                  of artistic lithography in England.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn79" id="fnref79" class="footnote-ref-anchor">79</a></sup>
                  The two men became acquainted in 1877, when Whistler was
                  already acknowledged as a virtuoso etcher and was also at the
                  height of his powers as a painter. Within the year, Way had
                  persuaded him to give artistic lithography a try, and to their
                  mutual and continuing delight, âthe master,â as Way called
                  Whistler, discovered that the medium responded âto his most
                  sensitive touch.â Although Whistlerâs biographers the Pennells
                  assert that the artist adopted lithography simply because it
                  âhappened to be the method of artistic expression which, at
                  the time, met his need and mood,â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn80" id="fnref80" class="footnote-ref-anchor">80</a></sup>
                  it is likely that he was also influenced by his French
                  colleagues, notably Henri Fantin-Latour and Edgar Degas, who
                  were engaged in lithographic experiments of their own.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn81" id="fnref81" class="footnote-ref-anchor">81</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whistlerâs first attempts were carried out in the traditional
                  way, by drawing with a greasy lithographic crayon directly
                  onto a porous limestone slab. The resulting prints, such as
                  <em>Study</em>, 1879 (fig. 3.12), have the soft-edged look of
                  charcoal sketches, in contrast to the precise, pen-and-ink
                  appearance of an etching such as
                  <em>The Model Resting (Draped Model)</em> (see fig. 3.2). The
                  classically draped figure depicted in <em>Study,</em> the only
                  early lithograph related to the Tanagra series, stands in a
                  highly contrived, contrapposto pose. Her head, in almost
                  perfect profile, turns toward the artistâs signature
                  butterfly, which hovers conspicuously just above her elegantly
                  disposed left hand. The butterfly cipher, originally fashioned
                  as a monogram, had been used in rudimental form in
                  <em>Standing Nude</em>, 1869 (see fig. 3.1); it was to assume
                  particular importance in the formally concise lithographs, and
                  Whistler would be fastidious about its placement and
                  proportions.

                <p>
                  After <em>Study,</em> the artist abandoned his efforts in
                  lithography for nearly a decade. In 1887, when he resumed the
                  medium, he employed the more convenient method of transfer
                  lithography, which his contemporaries in France had also
                  adopted. With that technique, he could draw on specially
                  treated paper that allowed the seamless transfer of the image
                  to the stone. In the process, the composition was reversed, so
                  that when an impression was printed, the original orientation
                  of the image was restored. Despite being one step further
                  removed from the stone, the transfer lithograph was even
                  closer to the artistâs original than a print made in the
                  traditional manner. It was partly for that reason that Camille
                  Corot advanced transfer lithography as the ideal method for
                  producing multiples of drawings.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn82" id="fnref82" class="footnote-ref-anchor">82</a></sup>
                  And âfrom the artistâs point of view,â as Lochnan has
                  remarked, âa simpler method of printmaking could not be
                  conceived.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn83" id="fnref83" class="footnote-ref-anchor">83</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nevertheless, it took time for Whistler to master the process.
                  The commercially produced, mechanically grained transfer paper
                  was disagreeable to work with; mistakes were hard to spot and
                  tedious to correct. Because an image drawn with lithographic
                  crayon is visible only as a faint stain on transfer paper,
                  stray lines and other imperfections become apparent only when
                  a proof impression is pulled from the press.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn84" id="fnref84" class="footnote-ref-anchor">84</a></sup>
                  In <em>Model Draping</em> (see cat. no. 17), for example,
                  Whistler neglected to remove the horizontal line at the
                  modelâs feet used to block out the square column of her
                  drapery; in <em>The Novel: Girl Reading</em> (see cat. no.
                  18), the viewer can barely make out the modelâs facial
                  features, and the delineation of her drapery gives way, around
                  the middle, to what can only be considered scribbling. âThere
                  is nothing more difficult in art than to draw the figure,â
                  Elizabeth Pennell points out in her article on Whistler as
                  âMaster of the Lithograph,â âand the difficulty is increased a
                  hundredfold when the medium is as inexorable as the
                  lithographic chalk.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn85" id="fnref85" class="footnote-ref-anchor">85</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The charm of these images easily conceals their defects: only
                  under close examination, for instance, do we discover in
                  <em>The Horoscope</em> (cat. no. 16) that the model may have
                  three legs entangled in her drapery. â<em>That</em> was a very
                  early and bungling struggle,â Whistler later had occasion to
                  explain, âwith the difficulties of a new material.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn86" id="fnref86" class="footnote-ref-anchor">86</a></sup>
                  Indeed, Whistler was so disheartened by his initial
                  effortsâthe first of the Tanagra lithographsâthat he
                  instructed Way, by then assisted by his son, Thomas R. Way, to
                  expunge them all from their stones. Happily, this did not
                  occur, and impressions were eventually printed with the
                  artistâs approval. In Wayâs estimation, the salvaged prints
                  were among Whistlerâs finestââof extreme delicacy, yet with a
                  certainty of line unsurpassed during any other periodââand the
                  artist himself named three of them among the four images on
                  the Tanagra theme that he considered âmost representativeâand
                  according to my own choice of quality.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn87" id="fnref87" class="footnote-ref-anchor">87</a></sup>
                  The aspect of ease that distinguishes the Tanagra lithographs
                  was therefore obtained only through unremitting effort: âThe
                  work of the master,â Whistler maintained, âreeks not of the
                  sweat of the brow.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn88" id="fnref88" class="footnote-ref-anchor">88</a></sup>
                  According to T. R. Way, Whistler might never have persevered
                  were it not for his wife, âherself an artist of real skill,â
                  who took a particular interest in his experiments with
                  lithography, âas though she felt it offered him a field where
                  he might surpass his reputation in any other of his
                  works.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn89" id="fnref89" class="footnote-ref-anchor">89</a></sup>

                  Like so many women of her time who managed to overcome
                  cultural expectations to become artists, Beatrice (later
                  Beatrix) Philip (1856â1896) was first the daughter and then
                  the wife of one. Her father was the sculptor John Birnie
                  Philip, who died in 1875; her husband, whom she married the
                  following year, at age eighteen, was the architect and
                  âaesthetic polymathâ Edward W. Godwin.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn90" id="fnref90" class="footnote-ref-anchor">90</a></sup>
                  Among her earliest works were designs for the carved bricks
                  embellishing Godwinâs Queen Anneâstyle buildings; she also
                  designed wallpaper and ceramic tiles, and painted decorative
                  panels for art furniture.
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn91" id="fnref91" class="footnote-ref-anchor">91</a></sup>
                  In 1885, Whistlerâone of Godwinâs closest friendsâhappened to
                  see a small figure painting in oil by Beatrix and was so
                  impressed, Godwin proudly reported, that âhe took it away to
                  show as the work of a pupil of his.â Her painting was
                  exhibited that year at the Society of British Artists, and
                  even though she had previously shown works under her own name
                  (or rather her husbandâs, as Mrs. E. W. Godwin), Beatrix was
                  persuaded, presumably by Whistler himself, to adopt the
                  pseudonym Rix Birnie, which disguised both her gender and her
                  identity. She was also identified in the catalogue as
                  Whistlerâs pupil, even though she may not yet have been.
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn92" id="fnref92" class="footnote-ref-anchor">92</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Beatrix Godwin was spending many hours in the artistâs studio
                  posing for her portrait,
                  <a href="https://www.umis.ac.uk/artefact/james-mcneill-whistler-harmony-in-red-lamplight-c-1884-86-oil-on-canvas/" target="_blank"><em>Harmony in Red: Lamplight</em></a>, in which she gazes at the artist with loving eyes. The
                  Godwins were by then estranged. His health had been failing
                  since 1885, and he died intestate in October 1886, leaving his
                  widow and their eleven-year-old son, Teddy, financially
                  insecure. Ostensibly in recognition of Edward Godwinâs âgreat
                  services to art in England,â Whistler started a petition to
                  raise funds âfor advance to Mrs. Godwin, to enable her to take
                  an assured position as an artist.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn93" id="fnref93" class="footnote-ref-anchor">93</a></sup>
                  Perhaps supported by the magnanimity of her late husbandâs
                  friends, Beatrix pursued further artistic training, briefly in
                  Paris but also in London, where Whistler taught her how to
                  etch. By 1888, she was recognized in the press as âa
                  remarkably clever artist and decorative draughtswoman,â whose
                  talents had only ripened âunder the influence of the great
                  James McNeill.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn94" id="fnref94" class="footnote-ref-anchor">94</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  As part of her re-education, Beatrix Godwin made numerous
                  studies from the nude figure, working on a larger scale and in
                  a more naturalistic style than her influential mentor. The two
                  artists appear to have worked companionably in the studio,
                  sometimes from the same model. Beatrixâs
                  <em>Nude woman with an open fan</em> (fig. 3.13) might be
                  compared, for example, to Whistlerâs
                  <a href="https://asia.si.edu/explore-art-culture/collections/search/edanmdm:fsg_F1904.63a-c/" target="_blank"><em>The Tall Flower</em></a>. The modelâs pose is only slightly different, but Whistlerâs
                  treatment of the nude, perhaps owing to the watercolor medium,
                  is the more delicate and tentative. Beatrixâs drawing is
                  fluent and assured. The model holds a fully opened fan by her
                  side, as if to indicate that nothing was to be concealed from
                  view; her downcast eyes imply her modesty, lending a touch of
                  irony to Beatrixâs frank image of female nudity.

                  The model for both works was Rose Pettigrew (1872â1958) (fig.
                  3.14), the youngest of three sisters who came to London from
                  Portsmouth in 1884, after their widowed mother was persuaded
                  that respectable artists would pay well to paint them. Their
                  first engagement was with the Royal Academician J. E. Millais,
                  who portrayed all three in
                  <a href="https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/an-idyll-of-1745-102591" target="_blank"><em>An Idyll of 1745</em></a>; after that, they never wanted for work and soon became, in
                  Rosieâs words, âthe best paid posers in England.â We have seen
                  Hetty, the eldest, as the model for Rousselâs
                  <em>Reading Girl</em> (see fig. 3.11). She and Lily posed
                  together in a series of paintings by John William Godward,

                  by the <em>Punch</em> cartoonist Linley Sambourne, who
                  sometimes posed them in the nude, relying on the images as âa

                  All three Pettigrews started working for Whistler around 1887,
                  a date we can deduce from Rosieâs memoirs, in which she slyly
                  mentions knowing âseveral of Whistlerâs âwives.ââ This
                  suggests that the Pettigrewsâ early sittings took place while
                  Maud Franklin, the artistâs longtime model and companion, who
                  liked to be called Mrs. Whistler, was still in the
                  picture.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn96" id="fnref96" class="footnote-ref-anchor">96</a></sup>
                  The Pettigrewsâ arrival in the studio coincides with the
                  commencement of the Tanagra lithographs: it was almost
                  certainly Rosie who sat, at age fifteen, for
                  <em>The Little Nude Model, Reading.</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn97" id="fnref97" class="footnote-ref-anchor">97</a></sup>
                  She also posed that year for <em>Peach Blossom</em> (cat. no.
                  48), Beatrix Godwinâs more conventional and ladylike rendition
                  of Whistlerâs theme, in which the model reads her book while
                  fully clothed and seated in a proper chair. The peach-colored
                  dress (âpink, trimmed with mauveâ) that in Whistlerian fashion
                  sets the pictureâs color scheme was probably among the âlovely
                  little frocksâ that Beatrix made for Rosie.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn98" id="fnref98" class="footnote-ref-anchor">98</a></sup>
                  âThe wife I really loved,â the model wrote, âwas the real
                  one.â
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn99" id="fnref99" class="footnote-ref-anchor">99</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whistler and Beatrix Godwin were married on August 11, 1888.
                  At age thirty-one, Beatrix had been a widow for less than two
                  years, but she was said to be bohemian, like her second
                  husband (then fifty-six), which implies that neither was
                  particularly concerned about the propriety of their
                  relationship. They had considered marriage only âin a vague
                  sort of wayâ before their friend Henry LabouchÃ¨re intervened
                  and set the date, arranging for a quiet wedding when Maud
                  Franklin would be out of town. âHalf the artist world would
                  have gone to see Mr. Whistler married,â one newspaper
                  reported, âif they had but known of it.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn100" id="fnref100" class="footnote-ref-anchor">100</a></sup>
                  The Whistlers settled into a studio flat in Tower House, one
                  of the Tite Street buildings that Godwin had designed. Beatrix
                  fixed her affections on Rosie Pettigrew, perhaps because her
                  own child was away at school. âMrs. Whistler loved me as much
                  as I loved her,â writes Rosie, adding, âShe wanted to adopt
                  me, but mother wouldnât hear of it.â
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn101" id="fnref101" class="footnote-ref-anchor">101</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  From that young modelâs recollection of Mrs. Whistler being
                  ever present when she posed, âto my great joy,â we are given a
                  glimpse of Whistlerâs studioânot at all the transactional
                  space of popular imagination, where innocent girls were
                  regularly exploited by aggressive painters, but a comfortable
                  environment contentedly occupied by three young women and
                  presided over by the artistâs wife, whose maternal care
                  modulated Whistlerâs aesthetic detachment. His own presence in
                  the studio is marked only by his butterfly signature, now
                  artfully intertwined with Beatrixâs trefoil monogram. The
                  lithographs created during the years of their marriage,
                  particularly the figural works we call Tanagras, appear to be
                  the emanations of a jubilant state of mind, for as Whistler
                  declared in the âTen OâClock,â âArt and Joy go together.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn102" id="fnref102" class="footnote-ref-anchor">102</a></sup>
                </p>
                <h2>The Beautiful Rosies</h2>
                <p>
                  The polychrome decoration of Tanagra figurines that appears to
                  have inspired Whistlerâs pastels in the 1880s may also account
                  for his experiments in color lithography, which occupied his
                  attention for three years, beginning late in 1890. His
                  ambition was to find a way to supersede the conventional
                  methods of chromolithography, in which primary colors were
                  overlaid to produce secondary hues that often ended up leaden
                  and murky. Whistler aspired to the clarity of color found in
                  Japanese woodblock prints, where brilliant hues were
                  juxtaposed, âas in a mosaic.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn103" id="fnref103" class="footnote-ref-anchor">103</a></sup>
                  Whistlerâs method, according to Joseph Pennell, was to begin
                  with a single drawing on transfer paper, printed in the usual
                  way; he then would make as many drawings as there were to be
                  colors in the final print, transparent overlays keyed to the
                  master (or âkeystoneâ) drawing. After that, the tedium began:
                  âThose parts of the drawing that are not wanted, that is all
                  but the red, for example, must be scratched or etched away,
                  and the same for the other colours.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn104" id="fnref104" class="footnote-ref-anchor">104</a></sup>
                  Finally, for each impression, a sheet of paper (antique or
                  Japanese, carefully selected by Whistler himself) would pass
                  through the press as many times as there were colors to be
                  added. His first attempt, <em>Figure Study in Colors</em> (see
                  cat. nos. 20 and 21), printed by Thomas Way, is a
                  straightforward image of a draped model sitting
                  uncharacteristically still, her hands clasped around one knee,
                  as though waiting patiently for somethingâanythingâto begin.
                  Whistler inadvertently bungled the process, making two of the
                  drawings on the wrong side of the paper, and he gave up in
                  exasperation after a handful of partially colored impressions
                  emerged from the press.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn105" id="fnref105" class="footnote-ref-anchor">105</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  When he finally had the heart to try again, Whistler sought an
                  experienced color printer in Paris, where other artists of the
                  Belle Ãpoque, such as Jules ChÃ©ret, had taken up the process
                  for poster art. On a brief trip to the Continent in June 1891,
                  Whistler met Henry Belfond, whom he considered the only person
                  in Paris to print âwith intelligence and feeling.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn106" id="fnref106" class="footnote-ref-anchor">106</a></sup>
                  At Belfondâs shop in the rue Gaillon, Whistler discovered a
                  new kind of transfer paper, poor in quality but rich in
                  potential, on which he made several drawings that were
                  probably intended to be developed into color lithographs. The
                  patchy lines in <em>Nude Model, Standing</em> (cat. no. 24),
                  for example, indicate the difficulty of drawing on the finely
                  grained paper, with the chalk skipping across the slippery
                  surface. Although he abandoned the design, a pastel made
                  around the same time, <em>Blue Girl</em> (cat. no. 42), gives
                  us an idea of how it might have looked if Whistler taken the
                  lithograph further. <em>Draped Model, Dancing</em> (cat. no.
                  25), another practice lithograph, shows a similarly irregular
                  quality of line, yet the dancerâs body and drapery are
                  depicted âwith equal evanescence,â as Sarah Kelly notes,
                  âmingling and obscuring her form with that of the sheer
                  fabric.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn107" id="fnref107" class="footnote-ref-anchor">107</a></sup>
                  Both prints, though technical failures, possess a beauty as
                  fragile and imperfect as the delicate transfer paper on which
                  they were drawn.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A few months later, Whistler returned to Paris for a longer
                  stay, and he and Belfond worked out a systemâor âarrived at a
                  solution,â as he later phrased it, âof the uncertainties of
                  colours in lithography.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn108" id="fnref108" class="footnote-ref-anchor">108</a></sup>
                  The artist would stand beside the press, mixing the oily inks
                  himself, adjusting the hues according to the shade of the
                  paper used for printing, and applying the color to the stone
                  âin the most personal manner, delicately, exquisitely.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn109" id="fnref109" class="footnote-ref-anchor">109</a></sup>
                  That deft touch, opposite in effect to the heavy-handed
                  application of commercial chromolithographs, especially
                  distinguishes <em>Draped Figure, Standing</em> (cat. nos. 23
                  and 24). Drawn in France from a model identified only as
                  âTootsie,â the figure is reminiscent of a Tanagra figurine;
                  she pulls her drapery over her head and touches her hair in a
                  gesture associated with the goddess Aphrodite (fig. 3.15).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn110" id="fnref110" class="footnote-ref-anchor">110</a></sup>

                  The enhancement with color completes what Nicholas Burry Smale
                  aptly describes as âthe realist subversion of the ideal.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn111" id="fnref111" class="footnote-ref-anchor">111</a></sup>
                  A more complicated image, <em>Draped Figure, Reclining</em>,
                  demonstrates Whistlerâs fastidious attention to nuances of
                  color; each impression represents a variation in tonal
                  arrangement (cat. nos. 30 and 31). Although printed in Paris,
                  the image had been drawn in London from one of the
                  Pettigrews,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn112" id="fnref112" class="footnote-ref-anchor">112</a></sup>
                  who does not just recline in this print, as the title says,
                  but falls asleep. Originally called
                  <em>La belle dame paresseuse</em> (âthe lovely, lazy ladyâ),
                  the lithograph is a further expression of the model
                  not-at-work, the embodiment of an art whose sole purpose is to
                  look beautiful.
                  <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn113" id="fnref113" class="footnote-ref-anchor">113</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In a related color lithograph titled
                  <em>Lady and Child</em> (fig. 3.16) (not, it should be noted,
                  âMother and Childâ), we encounter a new addition to the family
                  of Pettigrew models: Edith Gertrude, born in March 1889, the
                  fourth child of the sistersâ elder brother Alfred. The little
                  girl in her ruffled bonnet is propped on the studio sofa with
                  a yellow toy of some sort in her lap; she gazes steadily at
                  the artist while her aunt, nearly unrecognizable in street
                  clothes and a bergÃ¨re hat, takes the opportunity to rest her
                  eyes. In <em>Cameo, No. 1</em> (cat. no. 39), a rare etching
                  from this period that was originally titled
                  <em>Little Edith</em>,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn114" id="fnref114" class="footnote-ref-anchor">114</a></sup>
                  it is the baby who is coaxed to nap by her loving aunt, all
                  draped up and ready for work; in <em>Cameo, No. 2</em> (cat.
                  no. 40), the baby sleeps. Whistler also made several drawings
                  of Edith with her Pettigrew relation (probably Rosie) on
                  transfer paper, presumably meant as keystone drawings for
                  color prints. As with the single-figure Tanagra lithographs,
                  the models appear to have been free to do whatever they
                  pleasedâplay, sit, cuddle, or sleepâwhile the artist waited
                  for the pose that formed the picture.

                  The first of the four transfer lithographs titled
                  <em>Mother and Child</em> (cat. no. 26) can be dated to June
                  1891 because the old <em>papier viennois</em> on which it is
                  drawn makes it contemporary with the two Cameo etchings. The
                  other three, all horizontal, must have been made later in the
                  year, as they are drawn on the tissue-thin
                  <em>papier vÃ©gÃ©tal</em> that Whistler brought back with him
                  that summer from Paris (cat. nos. 27â29). Whistler fell out
                  with Belfond before the drawings could be developed into color
                  lithographs and they were put away, but not forgotten. At
                  Beatrixâs request, the drawings were retrieved in 1895, and
                  impressions were printed in London by the Ways with varying
                  degrees of success. Only then was the perfunctory title
                  <em>Mother and Child</em> assigned to every picture in the
                  series.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Had they evolved as originally intended, the images would more
                  closely resemble Whistlerâs pastels on the same theme, such as
                  <em>Rose and Red: The Little Pink Cap</em>,
                  <em>The Purple Cap</em> (fig. 3.17),
                  <a href="https://asia.si.edu/explore-art-culture/collections/search/edanmdm:fsg_F1904.1a-c/" target="_blank"><em>The Pearl</em></a>, <em>The Shell</em>, and they would probably bear titles
                  evocative of visual effects, not indicative of generic
                  subjects. The serial title makes it easy to overlook the
                  individual qualities of the lithographs, but Pennell, probably
                  encouraged by Whistler, singled out the second of the four
                  (see cat. no. 28) in her <em>Scribnerâs</em> article. Simply
                  titled <em>Mother and Child,</em> it forms the headpiece and
                  is praised in terms both technical and art-historical, as
                  being âinstinct with maternal devotion as the Madonnas of
                  Bellini or Fra Angelico, the plump nakedness of the child a
                  marvel of masterly execution, of eloquent form.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn115" id="fnref115" class="footnote-ref-anchor">115</a></sup>

                  How can we account for the efflorescence of this sentimental
                  theme in nearly every medium of Whistlerâs practice during
                  this late period of his career? It is possible that he found
                  inspiration in the Tanagras called <em>kourotrophoi,</em> or
                  âchild nurturers,â mortal women or divinities shown with an
                  infant or small child (see cat. no. 7). âThe Tanagra potter
                  was particularly happy in his renderings of figures or scenes
                  in which gentle grace predominates,â observed the Victorian
                  writer Caroline A. Hutton, citing an example in the British
                  Museum possessed of âall the sweet serenity of a mediÃ¦val
                  Madonna.â (That figurine has been revealed to be
                  <a href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/G_1877-0515-10" target="_blank">a reconstruction</a>, with a pretty young head appended to the body of an elderly
                  nursemaid.)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn116" id="fnref116" class="footnote-ref-anchor">116</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  More often advanced as precedents for Whistlerâs lithographic
                  theme are the comparatively ornate statuettes of Aphrodite and
                  Eros, particularly
                  <a href="https://wellcomecollection.org/works/p2gh6hhs/items?canvas=50&amp;query=eros" target="_blank">an example</a>
                  in the Ionides collection in which the figures are
                  recumbent.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn117" id="fnref117" class="footnote-ref-anchor">117</a></sup>
                  (Although it would not have mattered to Whistler, that now
                  unlocated figurine was almost certainly a modern forgery.)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn118" id="fnref118" class="footnote-ref-anchor">118</a></sup>
                  According to Olivier Rayet, the coroplasts were simply
                  developing a theme frequently explored by poets of the fourth
                  and third centuries, of love (in the form of Eros) attempting
                  to fly away from the beautiful young woman who tries to hold
                  onto it. One example shown at the 1878 Exposition Universelle
                  in Paris, in which a seated draped figure plays with the naked
                  baby in her lap (cat. no. 50), might plausibly relate to
                  Whistlerâs <em>Mother and Child, No. 1</em> (see cat. no.
                  26).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn119" id="fnref119" class="footnote-ref-anchor">119</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although Whistler was purging subject matter from his art, in
                  the Tanagra renditions of the mother-and-child theme he may
                  have recognized a relevant reconciliation of the human with
                  the divine. Marcus Huish, in 1900, imagines a Tanagra potter
                  charged with representing the âGoddess Motherâ but finding
                  little inspiration in the traditional type, while âin his own
                  house, he had in his wife and infant one surpassing anything
                  that he could imagine. If he possessed any artistic sense, he
                  would be moved to translate this into clay.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn120" id="fnref120" class="footnote-ref-anchor">120</a></sup>
                  In the same way, perhaps, Whistler recognized the mortal
                  equivalents of his own muse, the being he considers the
                  goddess of art, in the blithe young models who had the run of
                  his studio.

                <p>
                  Whistler might also have looked for inspiration to
                  contemporary works for inspiration. His fellow American
                  expatriate Mary Cassatt, for example, was experimenting with
                  color printing at this very moment, and an aquatint such as
                  <em>After the Bath</em> (fig. 3.18) approximates the quiet
                  sensuality of Whistlerâs works.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn121" id="fnref121" class="footnote-ref-anchor">121</a></sup>
                  It is important to recognize that Cassattâs figures, like
                  Whistlerâs, were based on hired models who were not
                  necessarily related to the children they appear to mother. The
                  maternal theme was a culturally appropriate way to express
                  ideas about artistic creativity, especially for women artists,
                  though Whistler himself once relied on the metaphor to
                  describe the process of art-making: âItâs the pain of giving
                  birth!â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn122" id="fnref122" class="footnote-ref-anchor">122</a></sup>
                  But the overarching theme of Whistlerâs imagery, as Katharine
                  Lochnan acknowledged, is probably not motherhood in itself,
                  but the notion of âwoman as nurturer,â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn123" id="fnref123" class="footnote-ref-anchor">123</a></sup>
                  the Greek <em>kourotrophos</em>. If was accept Whistlerâs
                  Tanagra images as the embodiments, or evocations, of his
                  museâthe âloving and fruitfulâ goddess described in the âTen
                  OâClockâ<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn124" id="fnref124" class="footnote-ref-anchor">124</a></sup>âthen the infant cared for so tenderly in the sheltered space
                  of the studio may be considered the exquisite creation of the
                  artistâs hand, the work of art itself.

                  However they might have been understood by Whistlerâs
                  contemporaries, these charming images would seem the most
                  likely of all his works to appeal to popular taste. Yet
                  Whistler rarely exhibited the mother-and-child pastels, and he
                  printed the related lithographs in tiny editions. Of the
                  handful that were sold, nearly all went to Charles Lang Freer,
                  his highly sympathetic patron in Detroit. The majority
                  remained in Whistlerâs studio at the time of his death.

                <p>
                  Whistler and Beatrix seem to have regarded these works as a
                  kind of joint endeavor, like aesthetic offspring, perhaps
                  inspired by the ambiance of affection they created in the
                  studio. To them, the images were highly personal, deeply
                  private, and deliberately recondite. We see this in the
                  letters written by the artist during his quick trip to Paris
                  in June 1891, while the series was still in progress. Whistler
                  reports to Beatrix on his visit to the gallery of Paul
                  Durand-Ruel to view recent works by his Parisian
                  contemporaries. âThere is a little room full of RenoirsâYou
                  have no idea! I <em>donât</em> know what has happened to the
                  eyes of every bodyâThe things are simply <em>childish</em>âand
                  a Degas absolutely shameful!â Had they been together, he
                  wrote, they would have held hands and summoned the memory of
                  âthe beautiful Rosies,â or Pettigrew pastels, presumably as a
                  defense against bad art. Because they were apart, Whistler
                  advised Beatrix to retrieve the delicate works from the
                  cabinet in the studio where they were kept and to handle them
                  with care. âTake the two drawers, just as they are, and carry
                  them up stairsâdonât let them be shaken, and cover them over
                  with a little drapery and wait till I come backâWe have no
                  idea how precious they are!â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn125" id="fnref125" class="footnote-ref-anchor">125</a></sup>
                </p>
                <h2>The Pinnacle of Fame</h2>
                <p>
                  For those who know Whistler only as the author of the square
                  and somber portrait of his mother, the drawings of lithe young
                  women entwined with naked babies can be difficult to
                  assimilate. The puzzle is only compounded when we learn that
                  <em><a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/portrait-of-the-artist-s-mother/2QH4InLXWX6UMQ?hl=en" target="_blank">Arrangement in Grey and Black</a></em>
                  (âWhistlerâs Motherâ) was in the Whistlersâ new London home at
                  21 Cheyne Walk in 1891, while the âRosiesâ were in progress.
                  âIt was hung rather low,â their parlor maid recollected, âand
                  looked for all the world like life and seemed too natural for
                  a picture.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn126" id="fnref126" class="footnote-ref-anchor">126</a></sup>
                  Yet Whistlerâs variations on the theme of motherhood, created
                  decades apart, in diverse media and on a vastly different
                  scale, identically express his wish to liberate art from the
                  expectations of convention. The portrait of his mother, as he
                  explained around this time to the artist Henry Tonks,
                  naturally possessed interest for him, âas he was very fond of
                  her.â To anyone else, Whistler said, shifting the emphasis
                  from sentimental subject to formal abstraction, âits beauty
                  could be just as well seen if they looked at it upside
                  down.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn127" id="fnref127" class="footnote-ref-anchor">127</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whistlerâs Mother was the key that unlocked the artistâs
                  lasting renown. In November 1891, it was purchased for the
                  Luxembourg in Paris, the national collection of works by
                  living artists, which destined the portrait, eventually, for
                  the Louvre. Its acquisition by the French state set off a
                  series of exhibitions and accolades that finally secured
                  Whistlerâs stature as an artist. As du Maurier noted in 1892,
                  âHe is now perched on such a topping pinnacle (of fame and
                  notoriety combined) that people can stare at him from two
                  hemispheres at once.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn128" id="fnref128" class="footnote-ref-anchor">128</a></sup>
                  Responding to the demands of his rising reputation, Whistler
                  was also living in two cities at once, making frequent trips
                  across the English Channel, but by March 1892, he was ready to
                  leave England for good, as his âstrongest art sympathies,â he
                  announced, were centered in Paris.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn129" id="fnref129" class="footnote-ref-anchor">129</a></sup>
                  In England that year, Whistlerâs French success was regarded
                  with suspicion until it was categorically confirmed by the
                  stunning retrospective of his paintings,
                  <em>Nocturnes, Marines, and Chevalet Pieces</em>, at the
                  Goupil Gallery. As D. C. Thomson wrote to Beatrix Whistler,
                  then in Paris, âTo those who have eyes to see, &amp;
                  fortunately they are increasing in number, the collection is
                  the most notable event that has taken place in London for many
                  many years &amp; it will stand out for all future times as one
                  of the epochs of art in this country.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn130" id="fnref130" class="footnote-ref-anchor">130</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Seeking out the artist at the Goupil exhibition, a reporter
                  for the <em>Illustrated London News</em> referred to a rumor
                  that Whistler had âinvented a new process of lithography.â
                  Whistler demurred, âI am simply busy with some coloured
                  lithographs, which will be seen by-and-bye.â The ânew
                  process,â he said, was only âa return to simplicity,â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn131" id="fnref131" class="footnote-ref-anchor">131</a></sup>
                  but that may have been wishful thinking, for the permanent
                  move to Paris had greatly complicated Whistlerâs lithographic
                  practice. While he continued working with Belfond on color
                  lithographs, he relied on the Ways to print the monochrome
                  impressions: âThese things are of great delicacy, and I could
                  not dream of running risks in other hands.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn132" id="fnref132" class="footnote-ref-anchor">132</a></sup>
                  Rolled up in periodicals for protection, Whistlerâs
                  transfer-paper drawings were regularly posted to London, along
                  with extensive instructions for the Ways: âOf course more
                  margin at the bottom than at the top. About paperâthe white
                  you sent, is <em>rather</em> too white.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn133" id="fnref133" class="footnote-ref-anchor">133</a></sup>
                  Their richly detailed correspondence illuminates what T. R.
                  Way regarded as âone long series of experiments, so frequently
                  did he vary his materials and his manner of using them.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn134" id="fnref134" class="footnote-ref-anchor">134</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The most consequential development in this period may have
                  been Whistlerâs adoption of the <em>crayon estompe,</em> or
                  âstump,â a tool made of paper wound tightly into a stick, or
                  stump, and suffused with tusche, a liquid drawing medium.
                  Whistler discovered that the stump imparted a particular
                  richness to his drawings, âa certain velvety daintinessâquite
                  unlike anything I have ever seen.â The effect is especially
                  striking in a pair of lithographs from 1893, referred to by
                  the artist in typical shorthand as âthe lying down figureâ
                  (cat. no. 34) and âthe sitting figureâ (cat. no. 33). Both
                  were drawn from the same model, a young Italian named Carmen
                  Rossi (born around 1878)ââa nice little Rosie,â as Whistler
                  described her to Beatrixâwho had turned up at Whistlerâs Paris
                  studio one day in January 1892. Together, the lithographs mark
                  an important advance in Whistlerâs process. âI am getting to
                  use the stump just like a brush,â he informed Way, âand the
                  work is beginning to have the mystery in execution of a
                  painting.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn135" id="fnref135" class="footnote-ref-anchor">135</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In <em>Nude Model, Reclining,</em> the heavy somnolence that
                  had suffused <em>Draped Figure Reclining</em> (see cat. no.
                  31)<em>,</em> the color lithograph from the previous year, has
                  given way to an atmosphere charged with possibility. The
                  modelâs quirky poseâhead supported by one elbow while the
                  other arm tents the drapery above one hipâcould not have been
                  maintained for long: as MacDonald has observed, âThe brevity
                  of this glimpse of the naked body is emphasized by the
                  conciseness of the technique.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn136" id="fnref136" class="footnote-ref-anchor">136</a></sup>
                  The unusual disposition of the modelâs legs may derive from a
                  painting in the National Gallery, Tintorettoâs
                  <em><a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/jacopo-tintoretto-the-origin-of-the-milky-way" target="_blank">Origin of the Milky Way</a>,</em>
                  of which Whistler kept photographs in the studio.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn137" id="fnref137" class="footnote-ref-anchor">137</a></sup>
                  Although it is difficult to reconcile the quiet languor of
                  Whistler's image with the frenzy of Tintorettoâs sceneâHeraâs
                  hectic suckling of the infant Herakles just before she repels
                  him in pain and spews divine milk across the heavens to
                  accidentally create the Milky Wayâthe visual quotation may
                  have been meant especially for Beatrix, as
                  <em>The Origin of the Milky Way</em> was her favorite
                  painting.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn138" id="fnref138" class="footnote-ref-anchor">138</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the second of the pair, the model has risen to a seated
                  position on the Empire-style sofa, though she seems even less
                  alert than when she was recumbent. Seated Tanagra figurines
                  are rare, but Whistlerâs <em>Draped Figure, Seated</em> may
                  have been inspired by a lovely figurine purchased for the
                  Louvre in 1876 (since identified as a forgery) of a
                  <a href="https://collections.louvre.fr/en/ark:/53355/cl010280752" target="_blank">woman seated on a rock</a>. As one contemporary scholar helpfully pointed out, ârocks
                  cannot have been used as furniture among the Greeks,â so the
                  rustic setting may identify the figure as a muse at rest in
                  the natural world.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn139" id="fnref139" class="footnote-ref-anchor">139</a></sup>
                  Whistlerâs draped figure is more luxuriously situated in the
                  studio, with the suggestion of a folding screen behind the
                  couch. Her body forms a sturdy pyramid, though one of her
                  legs, slightly bent, suggests that she might attempt,
                  unsteadily, to stand. In a telling visual echo of the
                  Tanagraâs gracefully bowed head, the dark halo of the modern
                  modelâs hair and scarf shadows her downcast eyes, conjuring a
                  sense of the semi-conscious, that hazy borderland between
                  wakefulness and sleep, making her appear, like the terracotta,
                  as if lost in a dream.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This was the figure that Whistler selected to represent his
                  art in a portfolio of prints called
                  <em>LâEstampe originale.</em> The publisher, AndrÃ© Marty, was
                  the leading advocate of artistic lithography in France, and
                  even though, as Whistler explained to T. R. Way, âthere is as
                  usual no money in the matter for <em>me</em>,â the lithograph
                  would appear in the distinguished company of works by such
                  artists as Pierre Puvis de Chavannes and FÃ©lix Bracquemondâand
                  so, Whistler decided, âLet us be very swell among them all.â
                  Marty himself collected Whistlerâs drawing in Paris and
                  hand-delivered it to the Ways in London, also providing a ream
                  of <em>gampi torinoko</em>, the sturdy Japanese paper on which
                  a hundred impressions were printed. The resulting proofs,
                  according to the artist, were âabsolutely perfect.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn140" id="fnref140" class="footnote-ref-anchor">140</a></sup>

                <p>
                  As published in <em>LâEstampe originale</em> (cat. no. 33),
                  the lithograph was unaccountably called
                  <em>Danseuse</em> (âDancerâ); perhaps Georges Vicaire, who
                  catalogued the prints in 1897, detected an affinity with a
                  Tanagra dancer, such as the <em>Danseuse Titeux</em> (see cat.
                  no. 1), and imagined her in repose. Whistler himself gave one
                  title to the lithograph in 1894â<em>The Seated Draped Figure</em>âwhen he sent an impression to London for exhibition at the
                  Grafton Gallery, and quite another when the lithograph went on
                  view with the SociÃ©tÃ© Nationale des Beaux-Arts:
                  <em>La Songeuse</em>, or âDaydreamer.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn141" id="fnref141" class="footnote-ref-anchor">141</a></sup>
                  In fin de siÃ¨cle France, that title positioned Whistler
                  decisively within the Symbolist circle. French Symbolism was
                  in many ways aligned with the aestheticism that Whistler had
                  long espoused. The movement was a reaction to the art of
                  description that had prevailed throughout the nineteenth
                  century in the various forms of naturalism, Realism, and
                  Impressionism. Seeking something more elusiveâessence rather
                  than substance or even appearanceâthe Symbolists fashioned
                  complex metaphors to suggest (but never describe) the faint
                  correspondences they detected between the material and the
                  spiritual. Their esoteric art was ambiguous by design.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn142" id="fnref142" class="footnote-ref-anchor">142</a></sup>

                <p>
                  StÃ©phane MallarmÃ© (1842â1898), the poet credited with endowing
                  the Symbolist movement âwith a sense of the mysterious and
                  ineffable,â had provided a French translation of Whistlerâs
                  âTen OâClockâ in 1888, affirming his own sympathy with the
                  artistâs aestheticist vision.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn143" id="fnref143" class="footnote-ref-anchor">143</a></sup>
                  In returnâas a symbol, so to speak, of their consonant
                  âaesthetic of implicationââWhistler presented MallarmÃ© with an
                  impression of <em>The Dancing Girl</em> (see cat. no. 15),<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn144" id="fnref144" class="footnote-ref-anchor">144</a></sup>
                  one of the first of his Tanagra lithographs. From the
                  Symbolist point of view, the dance is the ideal art form, âa
                  purely visual text that is fleeting and transitory,â as Sarah
                  Kelly observes, which finds a parallel in Whistlerâs ephemeral
                  lithographs. Moreover, as an instinctive, spontaneous
                  expression of joy, dance is an apposite symbol of the creative
                  impulse,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn145" id="fnref145" class="footnote-ref-anchor">145</a></sup>
                  and MallarmÃ© reciprocated with âBillet Ã  Whistler,â a sonnet
                  in which art is personified as a dancer twirling through
                  space, âa muslin whirlwind.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn146" id="fnref146" class="footnote-ref-anchor">146</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Imbued with art and friendship, Whistlerâs contented Parisian
                  life found expression in his lithographsânotably the images of
                  his muse, who regularly communed with the artist at his new
                  studio in Montparnasse (fig. 3.19). On the sixth floor of a
                  modern building in the old-world street of
                  Notre-Dame-des-Champs, the studio was âreally perhaps the
                  finest thing of the kind I have ever seen,â Whistler informed
                  his sister-in-law.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn147" id="fnref147" class="footnote-ref-anchor">147</a></sup>
                  Its perfection was confirmed by Robert Sherard, the English
                  journalist who visited the artist in Paris in 1893, though he
                  was surprised to discover that apart from the printing press,
                  âthe only commercial-looking thing in all the place,â there
                  were no signs of work in the studio, âno easel visible, not
                  one palette, none of the charming litter of the art.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn148" id="fnref148" class="footnote-ref-anchor">148</a></sup>
                  It was as if Whistler were encouraging the production of art
                  by denying the existence of labor, effacing âthe footsteps of
                  workâ not only from his artistic inventions, but from his
                  professional domain. The house in the rue du Bac, too, where
                  he and Beatrix had taken up residence, was an ideal setting
                  for aestheticism, âa sort of little fairy palace,â as Whistler
                  described it, ââa thing on a fanâor on a blue plate.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn149" id="fnref149" class="footnote-ref-anchor">149</a></sup>

                  Everyone agreed that the artist had never been happier than
                  during this interlude in Paris, âwhen he was acknowledged and
                  taken seriously as a <em>maÃ®tre dâÃ©cole,</em> and found his
                  work appreciated and sought for by collectors.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn150" id="fnref150" class="footnote-ref-anchor">150</a></sup>
                  His recent successes in lithography caused him to perceive the
                  medium as defining his future prospects. âI fancy I see
                  fortune looming on the horizon,â he wrote to Way in London,
                  âand I might really be rich!â He had âendless thingsâ in mind,
                  he said, ideas that had been bottled up throughout âthe hard
                  siege and open warâ of his previous, beleaguered life in
                  London.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of those âthingsâ was
                  <em>Little Draped Figure, Leaning</em> (cat. no. 35), another
                  in the series of lithographs drawn from Carmen Rossi late in
                  1893, which Whistler regarded as âa really delightful little
                  drawing on paper,â by which he meant a transfer drawing
                  intended for the lithographic stone, âunless I deceive myself
                  greatlyâVery simple and very fair.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn151" id="fnref151" class="footnote-ref-anchor">151</a></sup>
                  It revives a favored compositional type dating back twenty
                  years, and may be regarded as a languid rendition of the early
                  lithograph <em>Study</em> (see fig. 3.12). The model is more
                  relaxed, legs crossed at the knee, arms resting lightly on the
                  rail behind her, assuming an attitude that vaguely recalls the
                  standard Tanagra type of the semi-nude Aphrodite leaning
                  nonchalantly against a pillar (cat. no. 10).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn152" id="fnref152" class="footnote-ref-anchor">152</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whistler repeated the motif some months later in a drawing of
                  a leaning figure striking the same chiastic pose (cat. no.
                  36). The drapery is as transparent as that in the previous
                  image, where it is seen clearly only in the gathers forming a
                  pattern against the wall; in
                  <em>Little Draped Figure, Leaning</em>, the drapery forms a
                  more emphatic element of the composition, not altogether
                  successfully. Whistler had his doubts about the drawing, along
                  with another made at the same time (cat. no. 37), which
                  depicts the model from behind: facing the studio armchair
                  instead of the artist, she lifts her gauzy drapery overhead in
                  a pose possibly inspired by Watteau.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn153" id="fnref153" class="footnote-ref-anchor">153</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Titled <em>Study</em> by default, the lithograph recalls the
                  early, experimental <em>Model Draping</em> (see cat. no. 17),
                  one of the first works for which Rosie Pettigrew had posed,
                  showing Whistlerâs fascination with the graceful movements by
                  which she donned her drapery.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn154" id="fnref154" class="footnote-ref-anchor">154</a></sup>
                  In contrast, the unnamed model who posed for these Parisian
                  pictures was ârather a poor one,â Whistler wrote to Way in
                  explanation of these imperfect drawings, an excuse that
                  betrays the importance he continued to attach to his model as
                  muse. Whistlerâs dissatisfaction only deepened when he
                  received trial proofs, noting that the images needed
                  âcleaning.â In the end, he must have regarded them both as
                  beyond redemption, for no revisions were ever made and the
                  stones were erased after a small number of proofs were pulled
                  from the press.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn155" id="fnref155" class="footnote-ref-anchor">155</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  And yet, Whistler wrote brightly to Thomson, âthe lithographs
                  are daily becoming more perfect.â Accordingly, he raised his
                  prices. He had tried to appeal to a wider public by making the
                  prints available âat an absurdly small price,â but they had
                  attracted only âthe same small clienteleâ that dependably
                  purchased his more expensive etchings. Why, he wondered, had
                  he ever thought âthe âmassesâ would rush inâ just because he
                  set the cost of his works within their means?<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn156" id="fnref156" class="footnote-ref-anchor">156</a></sup>
                  To the writer for <em>The Studio</em> who interviewed Whistler
                  around this time, the artist avowed that he did not make
                  prints for popular consumption: âArt is the worst aristocrat
                  of all,â he declared. âIt has nothing to do with the
                  masses.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn157" id="fnref157" class="footnote-ref-anchor">157</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Though impressing the <em>Studio</em> journalist with his
                  âintimate knowledge of all the conventions and tricks of the
                  craft,â Whistler described himself with rare humility as a
                  beginner in the field of lithography: âThere is a lot to be
                  done yet.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn158" id="fnref158" class="footnote-ref-anchor">158</a></sup>
                  He still harbored hopes that he might âhave another go with
                  colourâ at the Waysâ establishment in London, and he felt
                  certain that âthe fun and the mysteryâ of the medium would
                  âbegin in <em>earnest</em>â as soon as he discovered the
                  perfect transfer paper.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn159" id="fnref159" class="footnote-ref-anchor">159</a></sup>
                  He was experimenting with the perfectly smooth, transparent
                  sheets of tracing paper used for making facsimiles of
                  handwritten documents. Extremely thin and hard to handle, the
                  paper nonetheless produced âa certain softness of quality,
                  almost at times a blurred effect,â as T. R. Way allowed;
                  because the glassy surface offered no resistance, the images
                  drawn upon it convey an uncanny sense of the chalk gliding
                  across the sheet, âexactly as his mind has directed it.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn160" id="fnref160" class="footnote-ref-anchor">160</a></sup>
                  These lithographs, especially, show no trace of effort, no
                  footstep of work. âThe line comes
                  <em>straight from his pencil</em>,â Whistler wrote, insisting
                  that a transfer lithograph would either perfectly represent
                  his intentions or betray him utterly, âin his weakness and
                  incapacity.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn161" id="fnref161" class="footnote-ref-anchor">161</a></sup>

                  The last of the Tanagra lithographs,
                  <em>Girl with Bowl</em> (cat. no. 38), represents the latter
                  outcomeâor so it appeared to Whistlerâs American dealer Edward
                  G. Kennedy, who feared that the lithograph could only damage
                  Whistlerâs reputation. Its cringing awkwardness was invisible
                  to Whistler, however, who replied to Kennedy with surprising
                  equanimity that the objectionable print had been âa great
                  success in Paris.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn162" id="fnref162" class="footnote-ref-anchor">162</a></sup>
                  The lithograph had been made expressly for a short-lived
                  Symbolist art journal titled <em>LâYmagier.</em> In efforts to
                  unsettle the traditional hierarchies of artistic genres, and
                  to question the distinction between copies and originals, the
                  quarterly juxtaposed contemporary works by artists such as
                  Paul Gauguin and Ãmile Bernard with medieval woodcuts and
                  popular imagery from Ãpinal prints. Whistlerâs lithograph,
                  which appeared in an issue featuring articles on monsters and
                  Saint Nicholas, followed reproductions of woodcuts by Lucas
                  Cranach the Elder.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn163" id="fnref163" class="footnote-ref-anchor">163</a></sup>

                  In that eccentric panoply of prints,
                  <em>Girl with Bowl</em> may show to best advantage. Whistler
                  himself maintained a peculiar affection for it, naming the
                  print among the few âchoiceâ examples of his lithographs of
                  nude and draped figures.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn164" id="fnref164" class="footnote-ref-anchor">164</a></sup>
                  The standing model holds at her hip a porcelain vessel, an
                  unprecedented prop in a lithograph though the bowl turns up in
                  several other works on paper from this period, often as a
                  container for a potted plant. In <em>Spring</em> (cat. no.
                  41), for instance, a glossy, white porcelain bowl, emblazoned
                  with a butterfly set inside a trefoil, holds a flowering
                  plant, presumably of some variety too rarefied to blossom in
                  the common garden soil. In contrast, the vessel in
                  <em>Girl with Bowl</em> remains empty, as if waiting to hold
                  some symbolic significance.

                  Beatrix, by then, had fallen ill with cancer; the Whistlersâ
                  Parisian idyll was over. The blow seemed even crueler,
                  Whistler confided to Kennedy, because it came âjust as ease
                  &amp; successâand even power &amp; perhaps even knowledge
                  seemed to be smiling upon us.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn165" id="fnref165" class="footnote-ref-anchor">165</a></sup>
                  In pursuit of medical attention, the Whistlers packed up their
                  Paris home and returned unhappily to London, where the artist
                  immersed himself in work, the only refuge for his abstracted
                  mind. Thomas Wilmer Dewing, an American artist whom Whistler
                  had recently met through Freer, their mutual patron, spent
                  some dark days that winter with Whistler in a borrowed studio
                  in Fitzroy Street. During that quiet period of the artistsâ
                  intimacy, Dewing drew his own draped model in pastel,
                  <em>Figure in Grey and Pink Drapery</em> (cat. no. 43). If the
                  medium, motif, and brown paper owe much to Whistlerâs
                  influence, the modelâs insouciant attitude, as Susan Hobbs has
                  noted, is again reminiscent of Tanagra figurines.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn166" id="fnref166" class="footnote-ref-anchor">166</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lithography was the one medium Whistler was able to practice
                  during the desperate days of Beatrixâs illness. T. R. Way
                  remembered how Whistler insisted that proofs be pulled at once
                  of each new drawing so he could show Beatrix what had been
                  accomplished during their time apart. To Way, this resolve
                  only confirmed her crucial importance to Whistlerâs
                  lithographic enterprise.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn167" id="fnref167" class="footnote-ref-anchor">167</a></sup>
                  It is a sad irony that while Beatrix lay dying, Whistlerâs
                  reputation ascended as he became recognized as the leading
                  exponent of artistic lithography; her decline exactly
                  coincided with the centenary of lithographyâs invention, when
                  âa craft that had gone into trade,â as one journalist
                  described the renaissance, âtakes its place again among the
                  aristocracy of the portfolio.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn168" id="fnref168" class="footnote-ref-anchor">168</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  For <em>Centenaire de la lithographie</em>, the enormous
                  exhibition staged in Paris that autumn, the Ways selected six
                  prints on Whistlerâs behalf that they believed to demonstrate
                  the variety of his work âfrom a technical point of view.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn169" id="fnref169" class="footnote-ref-anchor">169</a></sup>
                  Whistler himself was spending those months in Lyme Regis with
                  Beatrix (âstill far from wellâ), but even in that remote
                  locale he heard âthat <em>everyone</em> is much agog about
                  lithography and that the Paris Lithographic Exhibition is
                  attracting great attention.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn170" id="fnref170" class="footnote-ref-anchor">170</a></sup>
                  Not to be outdone, London was to have an exhibition of its
                  own, even though few artists in England were seriously engaged
                  with the medium. Marcus Huish, who was the director of the
                  Fine Art Society, where Whistler had long exhibited prints and
                  pastels, wrote to Whistler that it seemed a pity for amateur
                  practitioners, even if they were Royal Academicians, to be
                  soaking up the glory while âthe originator of the revival
                  hereâ was getting insufficient credit. To balance the scales,
                  Huish proposed an exhibition dedicated entirely to Whistlerâs
                  work in lithography.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn171" id="fnref171" class="footnote-ref-anchor">171</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  To Whistler at that time, an exhibition sounded like a lot of
                  trouble, âand I am awfully handicapped with trouble
                  already.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn172" id="fnref172" class="footnote-ref-anchor">172</a></sup>
                  Eventually, if reluctantly, he was persuaded, and an
                  exhibition of seventy-one lithographs opened on December 7,
                  1896, at the galleries in New Bond Street.
                  <em>Mr. Whistlerâs Lithographs</em> was an instant and utter
                  success. The artistâs longtime friend Ernest G. Brown, who
                  worked with Huish at the Fine Art Society, wrote to Whistler
                  about the artists and connoisseursâincluding the Prince of
                  Walesâwho were flocking to see the lithographs, âgenerally
                  considered the very best things you have done. There is no
                  doubt of your popularity now.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn173" id="fnref173" class="footnote-ref-anchor">173</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In February 1896, when Whistler himself finally wrote to gloat
                  to Kennedy about the exhibition, he and Beatrix were back in
                  London: âReally it will make you quite jealousâfor the success
                  was quite stupendous.â Yet the brisk sales, brilliant reviews,
                  continual commendations, all were as nothing, he said, âbeside
                  the health of our Lady, in whose happiness is all our hope
                  &amp; joy &amp; invention.â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn174" id="fnref174" class="footnote-ref-anchor">174</a></sup>
                  In hopes that a change of scene might lift their spirits, the
                  Whistlers took a room on an upper floor of the Savoy Hotel,
                  where Beatrix could look out on the river from a chaise longue
                  set beside the window. Whistler worked by her side, consoling
                  himself with views of the Thames in drawings destined for the
                  lithographic stone: âI am now doing the best work of that
                  kind, by far, that I have ever done,â he wrote to Kennedy.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn175" id="fnref175" class="footnote-ref-anchor">175</a></sup>
                  He also portrayed Beatrix in bed, poignant images that reveal
                  the gravity of her illness (fig. 3.20), even though he could
                  not face up to it himself: he named one of those portraits,
                  optimistically, <em>La belle dame convalescente.</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn176" id="fnref176" class="footnote-ref-anchor">176</a></sup>

                  After Beatrix died in May, Whistlerâs interest in lithography
                  faded away.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn177" id="fnref177" class="footnote-ref-anchor">177</a></sup>
                  At the end of his own life, however, he returned to the nude
                  figure, this time in a series of small oil paintings. The one
                  he particularly prized was
                  <em>Purple and Gold: Phyrne the Superb!âBuilder of Temples</em>
                  (fig. 3.21), begun by January 1898 but still in his
                  studioâperhaps still in progressâwhen he died in July 1903.
                  Its unusually detailed, allusive, and enthusiastic title
                  announces the subjectâs importance: Phryne was the legendary
                  Greek (indeed, Boeotian) courtesan who had the means to
                  rebuild the city of Thebes after its destruction by Alexander
                  the Great in 335 BCE, around the time the terracottas were
                  starting to be made in the neighboring town of Tanagra. It was
                  Phryne, too, who posed for the sculptor Praxiteles as the
                  Aphrodite of Knidos (ca. 360â330 BCE), the first life-size
                  female nude in antiquity (see fig. 1.14).

                <p>
                  Whistlerâs modest portrait belies its imposing title. First,
                  it is painted on a tiny panel, just nine by five inchesââsmall
                  and dainty,â as he considered paintings of these dimensions,
                  and âmost portable,â easily tucked by rich Americans into
                  their steamer trunks.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn178" id="fnref178" class="footnote-ref-anchor">178</a></sup>
                  Whistler briefly considered creating a full-scale version of
                  <em>Purple and Gold</em>, as he had once intended to enlarge
                  the oil sketch known as <em>Tanagra</em> (cat. no. 14), but
                  his preference for âthe daintyâ won out in the end. âWould she
                  be more superb,â Whistler wondered âmore truly the Builder of
                  Templesâhad I painted her what is called life-size?â<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn179" id="fnref179" class="footnote-ref-anchor">179</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Second, the painting presents Phryne as an ordinary artistâs
                  model, stripped of the accoutrements of her legendary wealth
                  and power. Having allowed her drapery to fall to her feet, she
                  stands stark naked before a makeshift backdrop, a deep purple
                  curtain that weighs down the line strung across the studio.
                  Unlike Whistlerâs Tanagra models, Phryne strike a formal
                  poseâperhaps owing to the greater exigency of oil paintingâbut
                  it is not the <em>pudica</em> stance, which would have
                  recalled the Knidian Aphrodite and implied an unwarranted
                  measure of shame. Were it not for the suggestion of a
                  Corinthian terrace on one side of the picture, and the hint of
                  Mediterranean sky at the top, Phryne might be just another
                  Miss Pettigrew posing in the London studio.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Perhaps it was the paintingâs air of classical antiquity,
                  combined with its unusually small scale, that caused Luke
                  Ionides, Alecoâs elder brother, to overlook the modelâs stark
                  nudity and regard the <em>Phryne</em> as a veritable copy of a
                  Tanagra figurine. âIâve always said youâre more or less of a
                  plagiarist,â he remarked upon seeing the panel in Whistlerâs
                  studio in 1903, certain that the artist had appropriated the
                  figure from a particular (though yet unidentified) statuette
                  in the British Museum. Charmed by the idea, Whistler suggested
                  that they go together to see the alleged prototype so he could
                  judge for himself; but on the appointed afternoon, just as
                  Ionides set off to meet his friend for their excursion, he
                  learned that Whistler had died that very day.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn180" id="fnref180" class="footnote-ref-anchor">180</a></sup>

                        There is no universal agreement as to the date of the
                        work formerly known as <em>Tanagra</em>. The

                        because of its resemblance to Whistlerâs so-called Six
                        Projects, which were under way during that period. The
                        Whistler catalogue raisonnÃ© (cited above) dates the oil
                        sketch ca. 1869 based on JWâs letter to Winans, but the
                        <a href="https://whistlerpaintings.gla.ac.uk/catalogue/display/?mid=y092" target="_blank">online version</a>
                        revises the date to 1869/1873 because of the butterfly
                        signature, which closely resembles that of

                        a painting in progress throughout the latter 1860s but
                        not exhibited until 1870 (with further changes made
                        later on). [Margaret F. MacDonald and Grischka

                        butterfly in the cartouche in the oil sketch is exactly
                        like the one that appears for the first time in the
                        dated cartoon, <em>Standing Nude</em>, of 1869.

                        It has been asserted that Alexander C. Ionides did not
                        bequeath anything to his sons in the belief that âdead
                        menâs moneyâ was a curse to male descendants: Dianne

                        This is a misunderstanding founded on a confusion of
                        Ionideses: it was Constantine A. Ionides, Alecoâs elder
                        brother, and not their father, Alexander C. Ionides, who
                        declined to leave money to his sons: see Ionides,

                        This idea owes its origin to Martha Tedeschi, who points
                        out that Whistler might have seen the prints in Paris at
                        the Galerie Durand-Ruel during November and December
                        1891. âIn the Studio,â <em>Songs on Stone</em>, 65. That
                        exhibition may have reinforced his interest in the

                        lithography because he was discouraged âby expense and
